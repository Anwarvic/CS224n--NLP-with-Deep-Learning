# Programming Assignment 4
Welcome to CS224N Project Assignment 4 Reading Comprehension.
The project has several dependencies that have to be satisfied before running the code. You can install them using your preferred method -- we list here the names of the packages using `pip`.

# Requirements

The starter code provided pressuposes a working installation of Python 2.7, as well as a TensorFlow 0.12.1.

It should also install all needed dependnecies through
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Running your assignment

You can get started by downloading the datasets and doing dome basic preprocessing:

$ code/get_started.sh

Note that you will always want to run your code from this assignment directory, not the code directory, like so:

$ python code/train.py

This ensures that any files created in the process don't pollute the code directoy.
