# CAUTION

This course was created in 2017 when TensorFlow 0.19 was a thing. By then, TensorFlow used to run on Python2. Now, all TensorFlow versions will be running on Python3.

That's why I solved this course using Python3 and TensorFlow 1.9. In every assignment, I have written a **starter code** for python3 that you can download and start the assignment with no problem.

If you found any bug in my solution, please don't hesitate reporting it.
