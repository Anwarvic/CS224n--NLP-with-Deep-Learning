Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .
Among Ike 's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) into McCarthy 's witch hunt for communists , which would interfere with , and perhaps delay , the AEC 's important work on H-bombs . The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC , J. Robert Oppenheimer , had urged that the H-bomb work be delayed . Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance , though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy .
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa ( now Umm ar-Rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan . On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . Six mosaic masters signed the work : Staurachios from Esbus , Euremios , Elias , Constantinus , Germanus and Abdela . It overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " Church of Bishop Sergius . " Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .
The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet , stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible , and that it has not claimed its predictions were " the words of Jehovah . " George D. Chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 , 1925 and 1975 , the changing views and dates of the Jehovah 's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions . Chryssides further states , " it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the Witnesses as a group that continues to set a single end-date that fails and then devise a new one , as many counter-cultists do . " However , sociologist Andrew Holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago , " Witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time . "
Police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention . This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead , especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict ( Goldsmith and Sheptycki , 2007 ) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions ( Hills , 2009 ) .
During the later part of the Malla era , Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities : Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , and Kirtipur . These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal . These states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . Evidence of an influx of ideas from India , Tibet , China , Persia , and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla . Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g . Tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g . Haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g . Mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . Amarkosh , a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD , was also found . Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square , Patan Durbar Square , Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the former durbar of Kirtipur , Nyatapola , Kumbheshwar , the Krishna temple , and others .
Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century . Among the rare examples are the 6th-century Christ in majesty ( or Ezekiel 's Vision ) mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times . Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church , which were made between 634 and 730 , also escaped destruction . Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki , often with suppliants before him .
In recent years a number of well-known tourism-related organizations have placed Greek destinations in the top of their lists . In 2009 Lonely Planet ranked Thessaloniki , the country 's second-largest city , the world 's fifth best " Ultimate Party Town " , alongside cities such as Montreal and Dubai , while in 2011 the island of Santorini was voted as the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure . The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe . Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014 .
In America , Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement 's seminal influence . In the United Kingdom , Colin Urquhart , Michael Harper , David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments . The Massey conference in New Zealand , 1964 was attended by several Anglicans , including the Rev . Ray Muller , who went on to invite Bennett to New Zealand in 1966 , and played a leading role in developing and promoting the Life in the Spirit seminars . Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus , inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition . Yaroslav , the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , Kiev . The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral . It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen , sent by Constantine Monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels . Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above . Below is a Communion of the Apostles .
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
In contrast to the Proterozoic , Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments , such as graywackes , mudstones , volcanic sediments and banded iron formations . Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations , consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks . The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs , while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin . In short , greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents .
The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma . The period was a time of great tectonic activity , as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together . The continent Euramerica ( or Laurussia ) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica , which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn . In these near-deserts , the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed , made red by the oxidized iron ( hematite ) characteristic of drought conditions . Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe , further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana . The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere . Sea levels were high worldwide , and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas . The deep , enormous Panthalassa ( the " universal ocean " ) covered the rest of the planet . Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys , Proto-Tethys , Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean ( which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica ) .
The Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056 . The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived ( Theotokos with raised hands , four evangelists with seraphim , scenes from Christ 's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos ) . In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures , detail , landscape and setting .
Believers in Pashupatinath ( mainly Hindus ) are allowed to enter the temple premises , but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River . The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka , South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla . This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam ( Unified India ) by encouraging cultural exchange . This procedure is followed in other temples around India , which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya .
During the Permian all the Earth 's major land masses , except portions of East Asia , were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea . Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles , with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ( Panthalassa , the universal sea ) , and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana . The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink . A new ocean was growing on its southern end , the Tethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era . Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ( " continental climate " ) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns . Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
Internal party disunity compounded the difficulty of identifying lawmakers who might have informally functioned as a minority leader . For instance , " seven of the fourteen speakership elections from 1834 through 1859 had at least twenty different candidates in the field . Thirty-six competed in 1839 , ninety-seven in 1849 , ninety-one in 1859 , and 138 in 1855 . " With so many candidates competing for the speakership , it is not at all clear that one of the defeated lawmakers then assumed the mantle of " minority leader . " The Democratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not " nominate a candidate for Speaker in two of these seven Congresses and nominated no man more than once in the other five . The defeated candidates were not automatically looked to for leadership . "
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) , law , grammar and rhetoric . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum , while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship . The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs can not be underestimated . Once humanist professors joined the university faculty , they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction , to translate and interpret classical texts , and to live honorable lives . Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts , as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts . Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno , Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts . The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship . For instance , Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen , whose ideas he verified through his own dissections . In law , Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective , while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist . Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts , which was important for the reform at Protestant universities . Galileo Galilei , who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua , and Martin Luther , who taught at the University of Wittenberg ( as did Melanchthon ) , also had humanist training . The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university ; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs , syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship .
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods : a boom period during 1900–29 , with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930 . The Great Depression and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline . The mid to late century were hard times , as the Bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty . The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today .
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
In the following century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art ( see details in Ravenna section ) . Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century . In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo , mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah ; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors , naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion . The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio , which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century , although it was restored many times later . The baptistery of the basilica , which was demolished in the 15th century , had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae , large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated . In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro , now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio , every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century . Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome , while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background . The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists .
Colloquially , the term university may be used to describe a phase in one 's life : " When I was at university ... " ( in the United States and Ireland , college is often used instead : " When I was in college ... " ) . In Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Nigeria , the Netherlands , Spain and the German-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni . In Ghana , New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called " varsity " ( although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years ) . " Varsity " was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] " Varsity " is still in common usage in Scotland .
Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it . They sought to create a citizenry ( frequently including women ) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions . This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis , today known as the humanities : grammar , rhetoric , history , poetry and moral philosophy . As a program to revive the cultural – and particularly the literary – legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity , Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like Rabelais or Erasmus as is still sometimes popularly believed .
YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate , and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site 's terms of service . In July 2008 , the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was " unimpressed " with YouTube 's system for policing its videos , and argued that " proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content " . YouTube responded by stating :
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages . The objective is to start a regular " Bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " Field Service Report " . Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive " .
As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid-1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9.7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5 % per year .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( Tennessee Constitution Article IX , Section 2 is one such example . ) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me God . " In some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . At one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma . During the early Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana ; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow , while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana itself rifted apart . The Tethys Sea closed , and the Neotethys basin appeared . Climates were warm , with no evidence of glaciation . As in the Triassic , there was apparently no land near either pole , and no extensive ice caps existed . The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe , where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas ; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen . In contrast , the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic , with few outcrops at the surface . Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic , most exposed sediments from this period are continental , such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation . The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic , marking the Nevadan orogeny . Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia , India , South America , Japan , Australasia and the United Kingdom .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious , miniature mosaic icons . In these icons the small tesserae ( with sides of 1 mm or less ) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel . These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion . The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century . The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle , humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
Second , Democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status . Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern . In 1919 , for instance , Republicans bypassed James R. Mann , R-IL , who had been minority leader for eight years , and elected Frederick Gillett , R-MA , to be Speaker . Mann " had angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor ; " also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon , R-IL ( 1903–1911 ) , and many Members " suspected that he would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker . " More recently , although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections , he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign , including the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting day .
The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make , promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods . Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus ; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson , all bearing the same name , also devoted themselves . Before the battle , Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate . When he offers sacrifice , the victim 's liver appears " damaged where it refers to his own fortunes " . Otherwise , the haruspex tells him , the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods . In a prayer recorded by Livy , Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus , charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks , and is killed ; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering . Had he failed to die , his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void , with possibly disastrous consequences . The act of devotio is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator .
Angels in the Outfield was Eisenhower 's favorite movie . His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels of Zane Grey . With his excellent memory and ability to focus , Eisenhower was skilled at card games . He learned poker , which he called his " favorite indoor sport , " in Abilene . Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates ' poker losses for payment after graduation , and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him . A classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point , Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months .
The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold . Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus . Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths . In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .
Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings , according to the principle do ut des ( " I give , that you might give " ) . Proper , respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity . Religious neglect was a form of atheism : impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia ( impious errors ) . Excessive devotion , fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio . Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger ( ira deorum ) and therefore harm the State . The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions , and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors . Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
Like the Speaker of the House , the Minority Leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position . When Nancy Pelosi , D-CA , became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress , she had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress . When her predecessor , Richard Gephardt , D-MO , became minority leader in the 104th House , he had been in the House for almost 20 years , had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years , had been a 1988 presidential candidate , and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections . Gephardt 's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel , R-IL , who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House . Michel 's predecessor , Republican John Rhodes of Arizona , was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925 , and continued through the Democrats ' control of the House from 1931 to 1995 , save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55 , all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent . The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965 , Hale Boggs who died in a plane crash , and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats ' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections . Since 1995 , the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner , though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections . He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011 . In 1998 , with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation , both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert .
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington , where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany . He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division ( WPD ) , General Leonard T. Gerow , and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division . Next , he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division ( which replaced WPD ) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
The Armenian Highland lies in the highlands surrounding Mount Ararat , the highest peak of the region . In the Bronze Age , several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia , including the Hittite Empire ( at the height of its power ) , Mitanni ( South-Western historical Armenia ) , and Hayasa-Azzi ( 1600–1200 BC ) . Soon after Hayasa-Azzi were Arme-Shupria ( 1300s–1190 BC ) , the Nairi ( 1400–1000 BC ) and the Kingdom of Urartu ( 860–590 BC ) , who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland . Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people . Under Ashurbanipal ( 669–627 BC ) , the Assyrian empire reached the Caucasus Mountains ( modern Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan ) .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
After fourteen consecutive years of economic growth , Greece went into recession in 2008 . By the end of 2009 , the Greek economy faced the highest budget deficit and government debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU . After several upward revisions , the 2009 budget deficit is now estimated at 15.7 % of GDP . This , combined with rapidly rising debt levels ( 127.9 % of GDP in 2009 ) led to a precipitous increase in borrowing costs , effectively shutting Greece out of the global financial markets and resulting in a severe economic crisis .
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era . Rulers from Tirhut , upon being attacked by Muslims , fled north to the Kathmandu valley . They intermarried with Nepali royalty , and this led to the Malla era . The early years of the Malla era were turbulent , with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims . There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu 's population , including the king Abhaya Malla . These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era ( such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan ) , and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city . Despite the initial hardships , Kathmandu rose to prominence again and , during most of the Malla era , dominated the trade between India and Tibet . Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade .
Kathmandu valley is described as " an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures " , which are made of wood , stone , metal , and terracotta , and found in profusion in temples , shrines , stupas , gompas , chaityasm and palaces . The art objects are also seen in street corners , lanes , private courtyards and in open ground . Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses . Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time , but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950 .
The centrality of the " separation " concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that " The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . "
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan ( 1906–1955 ) . It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings , letters and papers , memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members . The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to king Mahendra of Nepal ( 1920–1972 ) . Like the Tribhuvan Museum , it includes his personal belongings such as decorations , stamps , coins and personal notes and manuscripts , but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber . The Hanumandhoka Palace , a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar , contains three separate museums of historic importance . These museums include the Birendra museum , which contains items related to the second-last monarch , Birendra of Nepal .
A Vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and Roman matron and wife . Unlike male priests , Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of Rome .
While the decision ( with four dissents ) ultimately upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools , the majority opinion ( by Justice Hugo Black ) and the dissenting opinions ( by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge and Justice Robert H. Jackson ) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a " wall between church and state " or a " separation of Church from State " : their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall . Rutledge , on behalf of the four dissenting justices , took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case : " Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia 's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment , now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth . " Writing separately , Justice Jackson argued that " [ T ] here are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation . In fact , the undertones of the opinion , advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State , seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters . "
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that Christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . The national motto " In God We Trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . A circuit court ruling affirmed Ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible , " With God , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian . However , the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon , and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city . Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places . Buff ( meat of water buffalo ) is very common . There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu , especially among Newars , which is not found in other parts of Nepal . Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago . Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal , pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes . A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo . The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow 's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity . The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly Momo or Chowmein .
In the general election , against the advice of his advisors , Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South , refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party . The campaign strategy , dubbed " K1C2 " , was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues : Korea , Communism and corruption . In an effort to accommodate the right , he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only ; he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman .
Organizations including Viacom , Mediaset , and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube , claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material . Viacom , demanding $ 1 billion in damages , said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " . YouTube responded by stating that it " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
To a large extent , the minority leader 's position is a 20th-century innovation . Prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized , so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader . Decades went by before anything like the modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders . However , from the beginning days of Congress , various House members intermittently assumed the role of " opposition leader . " Some scholars suggest that Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned as the first " minority leader " because in the First Congress he led the opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton 's fiscal policies .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of God . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . They consider the Bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist Andrew Holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body , through Watch Tower Society publications , carry almost as much weight as the Bible . Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended ; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . Adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding . " The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
Motorcycles are also commonly used , particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach , to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles . Bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public . In addition , their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot .
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . Among these groups , many Irish Americans , Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here . In addition , French , German , Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . The Jewish population also increased notably during this time . In 1937 , according to Jewish organizations , 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011 . Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent . Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a microbe in a community , and other epidemiological considerations . Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .

Russell moved the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters to Brooklyn , New York , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel . He identified the religious movement as " Bible Students , " and more formally as the International Bible Students Association . By 1910 , about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re-elected him annually as their " pastor . " Russell died October 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour .
The synagogue in Eshtemoa ( As-Samu ) was built around the 4th century . The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns . The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya ( excavated in 1971–72 , founded in the end of the 4th century ) has three mosaic panels , the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine , two menorahs , a lulav and an etrog with columns , deer and rams . The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion’s den . The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels . The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center . It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community .
Quakers , or Friends , are members of a family of religious movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends . The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers . Many Friends view themselves as members of a Christian denomination . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity . Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity , the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous ; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian . There was also a drop in south polar temperatures ; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period , though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not . These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics , where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers . A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction , one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard . This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period .
In June 2007 , YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom , which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . The system , which became known as Content ID , creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . When a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns ; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae , and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës , Albania in 1916 , is an early figural example ; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC . Mythological subjects , or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy , were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design , with strongly emphasized borders . Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name , describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl . Both of these themes were widely copied .
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece’s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece’s Eurozone entry .
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
The Plymouth Brethren are a conservative , low church , evangelical movement , whose history can be traced to Dublin , Ireland , in the late 1820s , originating from Anglicanism . Among other beliefs , the group emphasizes sola scriptura . Brethren generally see themselves not as a denomination , but as a network , or even as a collection of overlapping networks , of like-minded independent churches . Although the group refused for many years to take any denominational name to itself—a stance that some of them still maintain—the title The Brethren , is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as brethren .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Kathmandu is dissected by eight rivers , the main river of the valley , the Bagmati and its tributaries , of which the Bishnumati , Dhobi Khola , Manohara Khola , Hanumant Khola , and Tukucha Khola are predominant . The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the elevation range of 1,500–3,000 metres ( 4,900–9,800 ft ) , and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley . An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu ; this canal is now extinct .
In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
World literature was enriched by the works of Edmund Spenser , John Milton , John Bunyan , John Donne , John Dryden , Daniel Defoe , William Wordsworth , Jonathan Swift , Johann Wolfgang Goethe , Friedrich Schiller , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Edgar Allan Poe , Matthew Arnold , Conrad Ferdinand Meyer , Theodor Fontane , Washington Irving , Robert Browning , Emily Dickinson , Emily Brontë , Charles Dickens , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Thomas Stearns Eliot , John Galsworthy , Thomas Mann , William Faulkner , John Updike , and many others .
Soteriologically , most Methodists are Arminian , emphasizing that Christ accomplished salvation for every human being , and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it ( as opposed to the traditional Calvinist doctrine of monergism ) . Methodism is traditionally low church in liturgy , although this varies greatly between individual congregations ; the Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition ; John Wesley 's brother , Charles , was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church , and many other eminent hymn writers come from the Methodist tradition .
Energy production in Greece is dominated by the Public Power Corporation ( known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ , or in English DEI ) . In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6 % of all energy demand in Greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . Almost half ( 48 % ) of DEI 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009 . Another 12 % comes from Hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . Between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010 .
Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms ( 1521 ) . In his view , faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could , therefore , not be forced on a person . The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience , and they practised separation of church and state . In the early seventeenth century , Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom . Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke 's stance on tolerance . Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams , Congregationalist Thomas Hooker , and Quaker William Penn , respectively , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion . These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities , including Jews . The United States Declaration of Independence , the United States Constitution , and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework . The great majority of American Protestants , both clergy and laity , strongly supported the independence movement . All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world ( e.g. , Latin America , Japan , and Germany ) . The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette , an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles . The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette 's draft of this document . The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings . Unpredictable weather is expected , given that temperatures can drop to 1 °C ( 34 °F ) or less during the winter . During a 2013 cold front , the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to −4 °C ( 25 °F ) , and the lowest temperature was recorded on January 10 , 2013 , at −9.2 °C ( 15.4 °F ) . Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based ( about 65 % of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August ) , and decreases substantially ( 100 to 200 cm ( 39 to 79 in ) ) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal . Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres ( 55.1 in ) for the Kathmandu valley , and averages 1,407 millimetres ( 55.4 in ) for the city of Kathmandu . On average humidity is 75 % . The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology , " Weather Meteorology " for 2005 . The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month . The annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres ( 44.3 in ) for 2005 , as per monthly data included in the table above . The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu . This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon . [ citation needed ] For example , 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu , totalling over 2,900 mm ( 114 in ) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season . In contrast , 2001 recorded only 356 mm ( 14 in ) of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season .
During Soviet rule , Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions . The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . In football , their most successful team was Yerevan 's FC Ararat , which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like FC Bayern Munich in the Euro cup .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma . During the Silurian , Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation . The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Rheic Ocean , a seaway of Iapetus Ocean ( now in between Avalonia and Laurentia ) , and newly formed Ural Ocean .
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture . Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .

Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . An example is the Academy of European Law , which offers training in European law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . EUCLID ( Pôle Universitaire Euclide , Euclid University ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations , its peoples and member states . The European University Institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the European Union .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
The first amendment to the US Constitution states " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " The two parts , known as the " establishment clause " and the " free exercise clause " respectively , form the textual basis for the Supreme Court 's interpretations of the " separation of church and state " doctrine . Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America 's doctrine for church-state separation : no coercion in religious matters , no expectation to support a religion against one 's will , and religious liberty encompasses all religions . In sum , citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith , any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary , and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism .
The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century , beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity , and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia . The early churches were mostly simple basilicas , but some with side apses . By the fifth century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used . By the seventh century , centrally planned churches had been built and a more complicated niched buttress and radiating Hrip'simé style had formed . By the time of the Arab invasion , most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed .
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty . A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064 . They settled in large numbers in Cilicia , an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times . In 1080 , they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia , which became the focus of Armenian nationalism . The Armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby Crusader States , but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions . In the next few centuries , Djenghis Khan , Timurids , and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians .
Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap . Mountain building in western North America continued , and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate , isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea . A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe . There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . During the Oligocene , South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America . It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow , rapidly cooling the continent .
Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of Latin , such as Cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the Greek equivalent Paideia . Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century Italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . Modern scholars , however , point out that Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . For Cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the drachma . After signing the Maastricht Treaty , Greece applied to join the eurozone . The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of GDP . Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . On 1 January 2001 , Greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . However , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002 . This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 March 2012 .
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950 , the hotel industry drastically improved . Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury such as the Hyatt Regency , Dwarika 's , theYak & Yeti , The Everest Hotel , Hotel Radisson , Hotel De L'Annapurna , The Malla Hotel , Shangri-La Hotel ( which is not operated by the Shangri-La Hotel Group ) and The Shanker Hotel . There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali , Hotel Narayani , The Blue Star and Grand Hotel . The Garden Hotel , Hotel Ambassador , and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu . Hotels like Hyatt Regency , De L'Annapurna and Hotel Yak & Yeti are among the five-star hotels providing casinos as well .
The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals . Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire : in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors . Ambrose , the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus 's request for tolerance . Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of Rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] He was the last emperor of both East and West .
Jefferson and Madison 's approach was not the only one taken in the eighteenth century . Jefferson 's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill , chiefly supported by Patrick Henry , which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination , but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it . Similarly , the Constitution of Massachusetts originally provided that " no subject shall be hurt , molested , or restrained , in his person , liberty , or estate , for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ... provided he doth not disturb the public peace , or obstruct others in their religious worship , " ( Article II ) but also that :
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community . Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta 's flame . The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home . Besides their own festival of Vestalia , they participated directly in the rites of Parilia , Parentalia and Fordicidia . Indirectly , they played a role in every official sacrifice ; among their duties was the preparation of the mola salsa , the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation .
As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid-1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9.7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5 % per year .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
In the 2005 OECD report for Greece , it was clearly stated that " the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece 's ] EMU membership qualification " . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece 's application , and thus the criteria had been met .
Educational attainment : In 2000 , according to the U.S. Census , out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old , 62.3 % had graduated from high school and 14.6 % held a bachelor 's or higher college degree . These percentages were lower than those for New York 's other boroughs , which ranged from 68.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 82.6 % ( Staten Island ) for high school graduates over 24 , and from 21.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 49.4 % ( Manhattan ) for college graduates . ( The respective state and national percentages were [ NY ] 79.1 % & 27.4 % and [ US ] 80.4 % & 24.4 % . )
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft , according to Foucault the police had an administrative , economic and social duty ( " procuring abundance " ) . It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d'état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population ( and unwittingly supervising the population ) , which , according to mercantilist theory , was to be the main strength of the state . Thus , its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns , urban planning ( which was important because of the miasma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . ) , and surveillance of prices .
In 2009 , Hispanic and Latino Americans represented 52.0 % of the Bronx 's population . Puerto Ricans represented 23.2 % of the borough 's population . Over 72,500 Mexicans lived in the Bronx , and they formed 5.2 % of the population . Cubans numbered over 9,640 members and formed 0.7 % of the population . In addition , over 319,000 people were of various Hispanic and Latino groups , such as Dominican , Salvadoran , and so on . These groups collectively represented 22.9 % of the population . At the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) . Asian Americans are a small but sizable minority in the borough . Roughly 49,600 Asians make up 3.6 % of the population . Roughly 13,600 Indians call the Bronx home , along with 9,800 Chinese , 6,540 Filipinos , 2,260 Vietnamese , 2,010 Koreans , and 1,100 Japanese .
The Armenians collective has , at times , constituted a Christian " island " in a mostly Muslim region . There is , however , a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims , known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race , while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years . The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States . Later on , the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin , the original seat of the Catholicosate . In 1441 , a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi , while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia . Therefore , since 1441 , there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges , and with their respective jurisdictions . The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia .
The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in Sepphoris , which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews , Christians and pagans . The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs . In the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted . Helios sits in the middle , in his sun chariot , and each zodiac is matched with a Jewish month . Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes , such as the binding of Isaac , as well as traditional rituals , including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
In the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times , notably in 139 BC and 33 BC . In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " Egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19 . Despite several Imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . In the late 1st century AD , Tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at Rome " .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479 , Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood ( Santa Hermandad ) as a national police force . They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves , and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases . The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835 .
Until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the German university model had spread around the world . Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . In Britain , the move from Industrial Revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray ( chairman of the University Grants Committee ) and Sir Samuel Curran , with the formation of the University of Strathclyde . The British also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in Europe .
Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine , mathematics , astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution . Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university , the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution . Historians such as Richard S. Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists . This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors , usually in princely courts , and associations with newly forming scientific societies .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
The word " police " was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century , but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces . The word , and the concept of police itself , were " disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression " ( according to Britannica 1911 ) . Before the 19th century , the first use of the word " police " recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798 .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
Penny Marshall 's 1990 film Awakenings , which was nominated for several Oscars , is based on neurologist Oliver Sacks ' 1973 account of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of encephalitis but briefly responded to the drug L-dopa . Robin Williams played the physician ; Robert De Niro was one of the patients who emerged from a catatonic ( frozen ) state . The home of Williams ' character was shot not far from Sacks ' actual City Island residence . A 1973 Yorkshire Television documentary and " A Kind of Alaska " , a 1985 play by Harold Pinter , were also based on Sacks ' book .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
Kumari Ghar is a palace in the center of the Kathmandu city , next to the Durbar square where a Royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides . Kumari , or Kumari Devi , is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in South Asian countries . In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous . Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju ( the Nepali name for Durga ) until she menstruates , after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body . Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status . The current Royal Kumari , Matina Shakya , age four , was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy .
Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942 . Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . He organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . Knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding Witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code .
Subsequent to this decision , the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause , known as the " Lemon Test " . First , the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose . Second , the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . Third , the statute or policy must not result in an " excessive entanglement " of government with religion . ( The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools , and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church 's religious mission , thus the policy involved the state in an " excessive entanglement " with religion . ) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause .
In 1913 the Zliten mosaic , a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests , hunting and everyday life , was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten . In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna , Libya , uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD . The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer , four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground , and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue , staring at his slain opponent . The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa . The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a " masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii . "
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian 's reign . The figures , animals , plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background . The portrait of a moustached man , probably a Gothic chieftain , is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age . The so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II 's reign around 565–577 . Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room . The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition . There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki ( 5th–6th centuries ) .
Jefferson 's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity , but this was a caricature . In setting up the University of Virginia , Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own , though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity , arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom . Some have argued that this arrangement was " fully compatible with Jefferson 's views on the separation of church and state ; " however , others point to Jefferson 's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation . Still other scholars , such as Mark David Hall , attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history
The Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14 . Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern . Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta . The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96 . In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .
After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa , Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily . Once Mussolini , the Italian leader , had fallen in Italy , the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche . But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians , the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country – making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of Italy was highly successful .
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate , Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea 's Hellenised elite . Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them . Early Italian synagogues have left few traces ; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period . Judaea 's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora ; in Rome , this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion . Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by Julius Caesar . By the Augustan era , the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews . In some periods under Roman rule , Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice , under certain conditions . Judaism was a superstitio to Cicero , but the Church Father Tertullian described it as religio licita ( an officially permitted religion ) in contrast to Christianity .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover .
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian . However , the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon , and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city . Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places . Buff ( meat of water buffalo ) is very common . There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu , especially among Newars , which is not found in other parts of Nepal . Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago . Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal , pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes . A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo . The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow 's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity . The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly Momo or Chowmein .
Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower 's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency . Meanwhile , Columbia University 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including Leonard McCollum , the president of Continental Oil ; Frank Abrams , the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey ; Bob Kleberg , the president of the King Ranch ; H. J. Porter , a Texas oil executive ; Bob Woodruff , the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation ; and Clarence Francis , the chairman of General Foods .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
A party 's floor leader , in conjunction with other party leaders , plays an influential role in the formulation of party policy and programs . He is instrumental in guiding legislation favored by his party through the House , or in resisting those programs of the other party that are considered undesirable by his own party . He is instrumental in devising and implementing his party 's strategy on the floor with respect to promoting or opposing legislation . He is kept constantly informed as to the status of legislative business and as to the sentiment of his party respecting particular legislation under consideration . Such information is derived in part from the floor leader 's contacts with his party 's members serving on House committees , and with the members of the party 's whip organization .
The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas , garnering little criticism , though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment . The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation . Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology ( the doctrine of how the church as a body works ) , they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers , compared to the Catholics ' idea that certain people within the church , or ideas that were old enough , had a special status in giving understanding of the text .
Beginning in first decade of the 15th century , Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest , Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe 's writings , founded the Hussite movement . He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination . He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance , Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . After his execution , a revolt erupted . Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope .
In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war . Believing that a general should not participate in politics , one author later wrote that " figuratively speaking , [ Eisenhower ] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office " . As others asked him about his political future , Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job " from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe " , and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions . In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired , the president would help the general win the 1948 election , and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower 's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination .
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
In the 2005 OECD report for Greece , it was clearly stated that " the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece 's ] EMU membership qualification " . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece 's application , and thus the criteria had been met .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of first-century Christianity . Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body , which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture . The Governing Body does not issue any single , comprehensive " statement of faith " , but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society . Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation , in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose , and that such enlightenment or " new light " results from the application of reason and study , the guidance of the holy spirit , and direction from Jesus Christ and angels . The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern " deep truths " , which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions . The religion 's leadership , while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility , is said to provide " divine guidance " through its teachings described as " based on God 's Word thus ... not from men , but from Jehovah . "
By the end of the early modern period , the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context . Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging . The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture , and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state .
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty . A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064 . They settled in large numbers in Cilicia , an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times . In 1080 , they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia , which became the focus of Armenian nationalism . The Armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby Crusader States , but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions . In the next few centuries , Djenghis Khan , Timurids , and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians .
After the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite in 1957 , Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA , which led to the space race . During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Eisenhower condemned the Israeli , British and French invasion of Egypt , and forced them to withdraw . He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action . In 1958 , Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution . Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident . In his January 17 , 1961 farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending , particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers , and coined the term " military–industrial complex " .
The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime-free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
The last three years of Eisenhower 's second term in office were ones of relatively good health . Eventually after leaving the White House , he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks . A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs . In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis , for which he underwent surgery on December 12 , 1966 , when his gallbladder was removed , containing 16 gallstones . After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 ( see below ) , an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma , a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease . Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death .
Protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . In the nineteenth century , throughout the Anglo-American world , numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . As an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . To Bismarck this was " practical Christianity " . These programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the Western world .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building , as the supercontinent Pangea came together . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana , which collided with North America-Europe ( Laurussia ) along the present line of eastern North America . This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe , and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America ; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains . In the same time frame , much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains . There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys . Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean ( closed by the assembly of South and North America ) , the small , shallow Ural Ocean ( which was closed by the collision of Baltica , and Siberia continents , creating the Ural Mountains ) and Proto-Tethys Ocean .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
The first amendment to the US Constitution states " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " The two parts , known as the " establishment clause " and the " free exercise clause " respectively , form the textual basis for the Supreme Court 's interpretations of the " separation of church and state " doctrine . Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America 's doctrine for church-state separation : no coercion in religious matters , no expectation to support a religion against one 's will , and religious liberty encompasses all religions . In sum , citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith , any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary , and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , in what the leadership calls a " theocratic organization " , reflecting their belief that it is God 's " visible organization " on earth . The organization is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size , but since early 2014 has comprised seven members , [ note 1 ] all of whom profess to be of the " anointed " class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the Watch Tower Society 's Brooklyn headquarters . There is no election for membership ; new members are selected by the existing body . Until late 2012 , the Governing Body described itself as the representative and " spokesman " for God 's " faithful and discreet slave class " ( approximately 10,000 self-professed " anointed " Jehovah 's Witnesses ) . At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society , the " faithful and discreet slave " was defined as referring to the Governing Body only . The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions , including publishing , assembly programs and evangelizing activities . It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers , after they have been recommended by local branches , with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions . Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants , and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief .
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint , Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation . Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . A variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : In fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names God knows . This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience .
East of the Bronx River , the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas , or 'necks , ' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh : Hunts Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck ( Castle Hill Point ) and Throgs Neck . The East Bronx has older tenement buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multifamily homes , as well as single family homes . It includes New York City 's largest park : Pelham Bay Park along the Westchester-Bronx border .
In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .

Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination . More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient . Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype . Other techniques ( such as X-rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent . The images are useful in detection of , for example , a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
The word " police " was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century , but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces . The word , and the concept of police itself , were " disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression " ( according to Britannica 1911 ) . Before the 19th century , the first use of the word " police " recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798 .
Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual ; in effect they were Rome in miniature . The commander 's headquarters stood at the centre ; he took the auspices on a dais in front . A small building behind housed the legionary standards , the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era , the image of the ruling emperor . In one camp , this shrine is even called Capitolium . The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major , set battle . A ram , a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded , led around the outer perimeter of the camp ( a lustratio exercitus ) and in through a gate , then sacrificed : Trajan 's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars . The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum ; all within are purified and protected .
Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination . More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient . Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype . Other techniques ( such as X-rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent . The images are useful in detection of , for example , a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion .
Most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . However , it was the retroactive application of ESA95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by Eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of GDP , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . This led to claims that Greece ( similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .
Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . The agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping . With 18 million international tourists in 2013 , Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world . The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world , with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
Until the 1980s , the governor of the Federal District was appointed by the Federal Government , and the laws of Brasília were issued by the Brazilian Federal Senate . With the Constitution of 1988 Brasília gained the right to elect its Governor , and a District Assembly ( Câmara Legislativa ) was elected to exercise legislative power . The Federal District does not have a Judicial Power of its own . The Judicial Power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories . Currently , Brazil does not have any territories , therefore , for now the courts serve only cases from the Federal District .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( Ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian . Geologically , the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . Throughout the early Paleozoic , the Earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea , which included most of the Earth 's land area .
In the United States , their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties . Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference , the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service , the right of patients to refuse medical treatment , and the right to engage in public discourse . Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada .
Among the vast varieties of microorganisms , relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals . Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect . The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen , depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen . However a host 's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection . Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens :
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's " Rational Clinical Examination Series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11-20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64-0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64-0.88 ) .
After 1517 , when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available , the Dutch humanist Erasmus , who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius , began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla , comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter . Erasmus , along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples , began issuing new translations , laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Henceforth Renaissance humanism , particularly in the German North , became concerned with religion , while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists , studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith . After the Reformation , critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school .
In May 2014 , prior to the launch of YouTube 's subscription-based Music Key service , the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were " undervalued " in comparison to other streaming services , and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014 , Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " Stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . However , YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ—as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
From the early 16th century , both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule . Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia , significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires . From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya , and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century , Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid , Afsharid and Qajar empires , while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule . In the late 1820s , the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan ( all of Eastern Armenia ) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran 's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War ( 1826-1828 ) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay . Western Armenia however , remained in Ottoman hands .
In the late 1130s , Arnold of Brescia , an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church . After his death , his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists , and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans , though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation . In the early 1170s , Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians . He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church . By 1215 , the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution . Despite that , the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy , as a part of the wider Reformed tradition .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . As a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . Also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . As a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms ( 1521 ) . In his view , faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could , therefore , not be forced on a person . The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience , and they practised separation of church and state . In the early seventeenth century , Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom . Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke 's stance on tolerance . Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams , Congregationalist Thomas Hooker , and Quaker William Penn , respectively , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion . These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities , including Jews . The United States Declaration of Independence , the United States Constitution , and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework . The great majority of American Protestants , both clergy and laity , strongly supported the independence movement . All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world ( e.g. , Latin America , Japan , and Germany ) . The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette , an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles . The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette 's draft of this document . The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition .
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful . In the early days of Rome 's war against Carthage , the commander Publius Claudius Pulcher ( consul 249 BC ) launched a sea campaign " though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices . " In defiance of the omen , he threw them into the sea , " saying that they might drink , since they would not eat . He was defeated , and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator , he appointed his messenger Glycias , as if again making a jest of his country 's peril . " His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career .
The Boudhanath , ( also written Bouddhanath , Bodhnath , Baudhanath or the Khāsa Chaitya ) , is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal , along with Swayambhu . It is a very popular tourist site . Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali . Located about 11 km ( 7 mi ) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu , the stupa 's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal . Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
Kathmandu valley is described as " an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures " , which are made of wood , stone , metal , and terracotta , and found in profusion in temples , shrines , stupas , gompas , chaityasm and palaces . The art objects are also seen in street corners , lanes , private courtyards and in open ground . Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses . Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time , but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950 .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "
Instruments like the duduk , the dhol , the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music . Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music . One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia . Many of these chants are ancient in origin , extending to pre-Christian times , while others are relatively modern , including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots , the inventor of the Armenian alphabet . Whilst under Soviet rule , Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music , for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane .
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
Punjab has the largest economy in Pakistan , contributing most to the national GDP . The province 's economy has quadrupled since 1972 . Its share of Pakistan 's GDP was 54.7 % in 2000 and 59 % as of 2010 . It is especially dominant in the service and agriculture sectors of Pakistan 's economy . With its contribution ranging from 52.1 % to 64.5 % in the Service Sector and 56.1 % to 61.5 % in the agriculture sector . It is also major manpower contributor because it has largest pool of professionals and highly skilled ( technically trained ) manpower in Pakistan . It is also dominant in the manufacturing sector , though the dominance is not as huge , with historical contributions raging from a low of 44 % to a high of 52.6 % . In 2007 , Punjab achieved a growth rate of 7.8 % and during the period 2002–03 to 2007–08 , its economy grew at a rate of between 7 % to 8 % per year . and during 2008–09 grew at 6 % against the total GDP growth of Pakistan at 4 % .

Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill , George S. Patton , George Marshall , and General Montgomery during World War II . Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur , and that a positive relationship endured . While in Manila , Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully . Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 . He also learned to fly , making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot 's license in 1939 at Fort Lewis . Also around this time , he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government , namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur , to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned , now named Quezon City , but he declined the offer .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day . By the end of the Mesozoic era , the continents had rifted into nearly their present form . Laurasia became North America and Eurasia , while Gondwana split into South America , Africa , Australia , Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent , which collided with the Asian plate . This impact gave rise to the Himalayas . The Tethys Sea , which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India , began to close up , forming the Mediterranean sea .
The Cathedral of Brasília in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil , is an expression of the architect Oscar Niemeyer . This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure , seems with its glass roof reaching up , open , to the heavens . On 31 May 1970 , the Cathedral’s structure was finished , and only the 70 m ( 229.66 ft ) diameter of the circular area were visible . Niemeyer 's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric . The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns . These columns , having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t , represent two hands moving upwards to heaven . The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970 .
In some countries , YouTube is completely blocked , either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest , the run-up to an election , or in response to upcoming political anniversaries . In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open , but access to specific videos is blocked . In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video , YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service .
European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( scholae monasticae ) , in which monks and nuns taught classes ; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century . The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools . It is possible , however , that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare , with the University of Paris being an exception . Later they were also founded by Kings ( University of Naples Federico II , Charles University in Prague , Jagiellonian University in Kraków ) or municipal administrations ( University of Cologne , University of Erfurt ) . In the early medieval period , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools , usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education . Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
The City of New York has an official television station run by the NYC Media Group and broadcasting from Bronx Community College , and Cablevision operates News 12 The Bronx , both of which feature programming based in the Bronx . Co-op City was the first area in the Bronx , and the first in New York beyond Manhattan , to have its own cable television provider . The local public-access television station BronxNet originates from Herbert H. Lehman College , the borough 's only four year CUNY school , and provides government-access television ( GATV ) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents .
Larry Christenson , a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro , California , did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans . A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in Minneapolis . Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential ; especially " Hosanna ! " in Lakeville , and North Heights in St. Paul . The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the Alliance of Renewal Churches . There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach . Richard A. Jensen 's Touched by the Spirit published in 1974 , played a major role of the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement .
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal . Of these , Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres ( 3,900–7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres ( 6,900–10,800 ft ) . Under Köppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( Cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . In the Kathmandu Valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C ( 82–86 °F ) . The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C ( 50.2 °F ) .
Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . Ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . Witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins .
The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks . The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets , saints and patriarchs . Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an Emperor kneeling before Christ ( late 9th or early 10th century ) . Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine . Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand . Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded . A mosaic panel on the gallery shows Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe ( 1042–1055 ) . The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church .
Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual ; in effect they were Rome in miniature . The commander 's headquarters stood at the centre ; he took the auspices on a dais in front . A small building behind housed the legionary standards , the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era , the image of the ruling emperor . In one camp , this shrine is even called Capitolium . The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major , set battle . A ram , a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded , led around the outer perimeter of the camp ( a lustratio exercitus ) and in through a gate , then sacrificed : Trajan 's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars . The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum ; all within are purified and protected .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
On November 6 , 2013 , Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented . The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments . They give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . In response , YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question " why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island , Chase Melvin noted that " Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who do n't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system " . In the same article Melvin goes on to say :
Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children . He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law . The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights . Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation , they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875 .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Active in the early 1920s , F.C.S . Schiller labelled his work " humanism " but for Schiller the term referred to the pragmatist philosophy he shared with William James . In 1929 , Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley , John Dewey , Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann . Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife , Clara Cook Potter , published Humanism : A New Religion . Throughout the 1930s , Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as , women’s rights , access to birth control , " civil divorce laws " , and an end to capital punishment .
In contrast , the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions . To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law , some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts can not be obtained in time , and where , without interference of the police , the realization of the private right would be impeded . This would , for example , allow police to establish a restaurant guest 's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest can not pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table .
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal . Of these , Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres ( 3,900–7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres ( 6,900–10,800 ft ) . Under Köppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( Cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . In the Kathmandu Valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C ( 82–86 °F ) . The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C ( 50.2 °F ) .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
In the judgment of political scientist Randall Ripley , since 1883 " the candidate for Speaker nominated by the minority party has clearly been the Minority Leader . " However , this assertion is subject to dispute . On December 3 , 1883 , the House elected Democrat John G. Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker . Republicans placed in nomination for the speakership J. Warren Keifer of Ohio , who was Speaker the previous Congress . Clearly , Keifer was not the Republicans ' minority leader . He was a discredited leader in part because as Speaker he arbitrarily handed out " choice jobs to close relatives ... all at handsome salaries . " Keifer received " the empty honor of the minority nomination . But with it came a sting -- for while this naturally involves the floor leadership , he was deserted by his [ partisan ] associates and his career as a national figure terminated ingloriously . " Representative Thomas Reed , R-ME , who later became Speaker , assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in Keifer 's stead . " [ A ] lthough Keifer was the minority 's candidate for Speaker , Reed became its acknowledged leader , and ever after , so long as he served in the House , remained the most conspicuous member of his party .
Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD , when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet . This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature . Early Armenian literature was written by the " father of Armenian history " , Moses of Chorene , who authored The History of Armenia . The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD . The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature . This period of time , during which Armenian culture flourished , is known as the Revival period ( Zartonki sherchan ) . The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis , almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe , were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism . Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience , and preferred them over classical Armenian ( grabar ) . This period ended after the Hamidian massacres , when Armenians experienced turbulent times . As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed , writers like Paruyr Sevak , Gevork Emin , Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature .
The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza . In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus , identified by his name in Hebrew letters . Near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . The floor was paved in 508/509 . It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon ( Menois ) and the Christian church at Shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
Juscelino Kubitschek , President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961 , ordered the construction of Brasília , fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise . Building Brasília was part of Juscelino 's " fifty years of prosperity in five " plan . Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 , with 5550 people competing . Oscar Niemeyer , a close friend , was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer . Brasília was built in 41 months , from 1956 to April 21 , 1960 , when it was officially inaugurated .
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions , which they consider a violation of God 's law based on their interpretation of Acts 15:28 , 29 and other scriptures . Since 1961 the willing acceptance of a blood transfusion by an unrepentant member has been grounds for expulsion from the religion . Members are directed to refuse blood transfusions , even in " a life-or-death situation " . Jehovah 's Witnesses accept non-blood alternatives and other medical procedures in lieu of blood transfusions , and their literature provides information about non-blood medical procedures .
The agglomeration of Kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . The urban area of the Kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . They have the three highest population densities in the country . Within the districts lie VDCs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( Bhaktapur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( Lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( Kathmandu ) . Some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , Gonggabu VDC notably recorded a density over 20,000 people/km2 . ( 2011 census ) . The following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece’s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece’s Eurozone entry .
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
Historians trace the earliest church labeled Baptist back to 1609 in Amsterdam , with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the mid-18th century , the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South . The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership , as did the preachers ' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery , which had been part of the 18th-century teachings . Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent .
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture . Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .
6th-century BCE pre-Socratic Greek philosophers Thales of Miletus and Xenophanes of Colophon were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition , thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists . Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe . These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm . Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens . Pericles , the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras . Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include Protagoras ( like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles ) , known for his famous dictum " man is the measure of all things " and Democritus , who proposed that matter was composed of atoms . Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers , principally Plato and Aristotle . The historian Thucydides , noted for his scientific and rational approach to history , is also much admired by later humanists . In the 3rd century BCE , Epicurus became known for his concise phrasing of the problem of evil , lack of belief in the afterlife , and human-centred approaches to achieving eudaimonia . He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule .
Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal , displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists . Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts . Art in Kathmandu is vibrant , demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art , derived from a great number of national , Asian , and global influences . Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas : the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet , closely linked to the country 's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting , including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for . Internationally , the British-based charity , the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu .
Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery , exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university , and the ideas of those texts into society generally , their influence was ultimately quite progressive . The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate ( as the notable list of scholars above attests to ) . A focus on knowledge coming from self , from the human , has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction , and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities . This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts , but also their adaptation and expansion . For instance , Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen , but he also invigorated this text with experimentation , disagreements and further research . The propagation of these texts , especially within the universities , was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular , which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices .
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command , on December 20 , 1944 , he was promoted to General of the Army , equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies . In this and the previous high commands he held , Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy . Although he had never seen action himself , he won the respect of front-line commanders . He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill , Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle . He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy , but these rarely upset his relationships with them . He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov , his Russian counterpart , and they became good friends .
Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination . More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient . Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype . Other techniques ( such as X-rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent . The images are useful in detection of , for example , a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion .
Several countries have established their national churches , linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state . Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries ; Denmark ( including Greenland ) , the Faroe Islands ( its church being independent since 2007 ) , Iceland and Norway have established Evangelical Lutheran churches . Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world , while Tonga—in the Methodist tradition . The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England , and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders . When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah 's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt , provide help and possibly administer discipline . Disfellowshipping , a form of shunning , is the strongest form of discipline , administered to an offender deemed unrepentant . Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home , and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement ; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged . Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that " losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [ the shunned individual ] to come 'to his senses , ' see the seriousness of his wrong , and take steps to return to Jehovah . " The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior . Members who disassociate ( formally resign ) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned . Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced . Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin ; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service , but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship . Marking , a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship , is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin . [ note 4 ]
Throughout his presidency , Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism . A self-described " progressive conservative , " he continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation , especially Social Security . He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers . He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years , which had not been completed under Truman .
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
A loblolly pine , known as the " Eisenhower Pine " , was located on Augusta 's 17th hole , approximately 210 yards ( 192 m ) from the Masters tee . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , an Augusta National member , hit the tree so many times that , at a 1956 club meeting , he proposed that it be cut down . Not wanting to offend the president , the club 's chairman , Clifford Roberts , immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request . The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage .
Protestants reject the Roman Catholic Church 's doctrine that it is the one true church , believing in the invisible church , which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ . Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations , and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others . Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences . Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs . Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith , non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant .
Once the coastal assault had succeeded , Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy , and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany . Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group 's attack being made in the north , while Generals Bradley ( 12th U.S. Army Group ) and Devers ( Sixth U.S. Army Group ) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front ( respectively ) . Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces , often by giving them tactical , though sometimes ineffective , latitude ; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe . However , due to Eisenhower 's persistence , the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully , albeit belatedly , opened in late 1944 , and victory became a more distinct probability .
Despite popular conceptions promoted by movies and television , many US police departments prefer not to maintain officers in non-patrol bureaus and divisions beyond a certain period of time , such as in the detective bureau , and instead maintain policies that limit service in such divisions to a specified period of time , after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties . [ citation needed ] This is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats , prevent crime by their presence , respond to crimes in progress , manage crises , and practice their skills .

Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that " Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making . " Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles . They were diverse in style , rich in color and ornamental motifs , and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them , such as artsvagorgs ( eagle-carpets ) , vishapagorgs ( dragon-carpets ) and otsagorgs ( serpent-carpets ) . The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches , " covered with vegatative ornaments " , and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh .
Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired . Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans , while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism . In selecting a Chief Justice , Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives , noting privately that Warren " represents the kind of political , economic , and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court ... He has a national name for integrity , uprightness , and courage that , again , I believe we need on the Court " . In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople . Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels , the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia . They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites . The esonarthex has two fluted domes , specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ . The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos . The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban , offering the model of the church to Christ . The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ . These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings , landscapes , figures .
Exhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage . The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions are held . It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots .
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus , inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition . Yaroslav , the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , Kiev . The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral . It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen , sent by Constantine Monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels . Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above . Below is a Communion of the Apostles .
Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages . The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
Greece 's rail network is estimated to be at 2,548 km . Rail transport in Greece is operated by TrainOSE , a subsidiary of the Hellenic Railways Organization ( OSE ) . Most of the country 's network is standard gauge ( 1,565 km ) , while the country also has 983 km of narrow gauge . A total of 764 km of rail are electrified . Greece has rail connections with Bulgaria , the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey . A total of three suburban railway systems ( Proastiakos ) are in operation ( in Athens , Thessaloniki and Patras ) , while one metro system is operational in Athens with another under construction .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily . The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina . The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor . Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos .
There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic : opus vermiculatum used tiny tesserae , typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less , and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support . The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail , and an approach to the illusionism of painting . Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work . The normal technique was opus tessellatum , using larger tesserae , which was laid on site . There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background , which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work .
Jefferson and Madison 's approach was not the only one taken in the eighteenth century . Jefferson 's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill , chiefly supported by Patrick Henry , which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination , but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it . Similarly , the Constitution of Massachusetts originally provided that " no subject shall be hurt , molested , or restrained , in his person , liberty , or estate , for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ... provided he doth not disturb the public peace , or obstruct others in their religious worship , " ( Article II ) but also that :
In the Presidential primary elections of February 5 , 2008 , Sen. Clinton won 61.2 % of the Bronx 's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8 % for Barack Obama and 1.0 % for the other four candidates combined ( John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Bill Richardson and Joe Biden ) . On the same day , John McCain won 54.4 % of the borough 's 5,643 Republican votes , Mitt Romney 20.8 % , Mike Huckabee 8.2 % , Ron Paul 7.4 % , Rudy Giuliani 5.6 % , and the other candidates ( Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes ) 3.6 % between them .
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
Within the diasporan Armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of Armenians . For example , Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as Parskahay ( Պարսկահայ ) , while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as Lipananahay ( Լիբանանահայ ) . Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language . This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine , Russia , and Georgia ( where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province ) . In diverse communities ( such as in Canada and the U.S. ) where many different kinds of Armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data , Arno Tausch ( Corvinus University of Budapest ) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism . The Global Value Development Index , calculated by Tausch , relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law , no support for shadow economy , postmaterial activism , support for democracy , a non-acceptance of violence , xenophobia and racism , trust in transnational capital and Universities , confidence in the market economy , supporting gender justice , and engaging in environmental activism , etc .
The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha . It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches , each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra , om mani padme hum . At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima , the goddess of smallpox . Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure , walk around the stupa with prayer wheels , chant , and pray . Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex . The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas ( monasteries ) around Boudhanath .
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow . Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America ( the Western Interior Seaway ) and Europe , then receded late in the period , leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds . At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression , one-third of Earth 's present land area was submerged . The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk ; indeed , more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic . Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather , the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium ; this made the oceans more saturated , as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton . These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine . Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas 's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation . Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China . In the area that is now India , massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
The metro leaves the Rodoviária ( bus station ) and goes south , avoiding most of the political and tourist areas . The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities , such as Samambaia , Taguatinga and Ceilândia , as well as Guará and Águas Claras . The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself ( the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants , Taguatinga had 243,575 , whereas the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants ) , and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation .
The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris , then the largest city in Europe . The royal edict , registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15 , 1667 created the office of lieutenant général de police ( " lieutenant general of police " ) , who was to be the head of the new Paris police force , and defined the task of the police as " ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals , purging the city of what may cause disturbances , procuring abundance , and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties " .
The synagogue in Eshtemoa ( As-Samu ) was built around the 4th century . The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns . The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya ( excavated in 1971–72 , founded in the end of the 4th century ) has three mosaic panels , the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine , two menorahs , a lulav and an etrog with columns , deer and rams . The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion’s den . The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels . The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center . It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
In the 1970s , the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson . The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities , like the South Bronx . The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area . The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment , which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx .
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style , free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space . Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .
Motorcycles are also commonly used , particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach , to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles . Bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public . In addition , their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot .
Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide , typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire . Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict . ( See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide )
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
According to a story that has often been repeated in the media , Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005 , after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen 's apartment in San Francisco . Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred , but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party " was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible " .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced : some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred . Others complied . Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian , but powerful and influential ; and some provincial authorities were lenient , notably the Caesar in Gaul , Constantius Chlorus , the father of Constantine I. Diocletian 's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311 , when he asked Christians to pray for him . " This meant an ofﬁcial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire , although one of the tetrarchs , Maximinus Daia , still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313 . "
In 1758 , the general of the Hindu Maratha Empire , Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Attock . Timur Shah Durrani , the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali , was driven out of Punjab . Lahore , Multan , Dera Ghazi Khan , Kashmir and other subahs on the south and eastern side of Peshawar were under the Maratha rule for the most part . In Punjab and Kashmir , the Marathas were now major players . The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 1761 , Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded the Maratha territory of Punjab and captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and re-consolidated control over them .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
Eisenhower , as well as the officers and troops under him , had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations , and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault . His first struggles , however , were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion ; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord . Admiral Ernest J . King fought with Eisenhower over King 's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific . He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord , to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented , as he did . Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter 's concern with civilian casualties ; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans , and Eisenhower prevailed . He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton , by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate , and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy .
Witnesses believe that a " little flock " go to heaven , but that the hope for life after death for the majority of " other sheep " involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon . They interpret Revelation 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000 , who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth . Jehovah 's Witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon , but that God is the final judge . During Christ 's millennial reign , most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever ; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium .
Most videos enable users to leave comments , and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content . In 2006 , Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling " community and collaboration on a scale never seen before " , and added that YouTube " harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom . Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone , never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred " . The Guardian in 2009 described users ' comments on YouTube as :
In 1957 , the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision . Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order . When Faubus balked , the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division . They escorted and protected nine black students ' entry to Little Rock Central High School , an all-white public school , for the first time since the Reconstruction Era . Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions , writing " The overwhelming majority of southerners , Negro and white , stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock " .

The Licchavis from the Indo-Gangetic plain migrated north and defeated the Kiratas , establishing the Licchavi dynasty . During this era , following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka , the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas . From Sankhu , they migrated to Yambu and Yengal ( Lanjagwal and Manjupattan ) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu . This created the basis of Newar Buddhism , which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world . With their migration , Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram during most of the Licchavi era .
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time , a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , only 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville , Dauphin County , Pennsylvania . In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service . In retirement , the former president did not completely retreat from political life ; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg . However , his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as " a dime-store New Dealer " .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
On 31 October 1517 , Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints ' , the Castle Church in Wittenberg . The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy , but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory , particular judgment , and the authority of the pope . He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary , the intercession of and devotion to the saints , the sacraments , mandatory clerical celibacy , monasticism , further on the authority of the pope , the ecclesiastical law , censure and excommunication , the role of secular rulers in religious matters , the relationship between Christianity and the law , good works , and the sacraments .
Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement . Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles , gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way ( via media ) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions . The English Reformation followed a particular course . The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII . King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome . In 1534 , the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . Between 1535 and 1540 , under Thomas Cromwell , the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect . Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I , a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I . The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition . The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other . It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . Deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : Juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; Jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . Di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as Mars , Janus , Neptune and various genii – including the Emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . After the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . Rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .
The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball . The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue , a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships . With the famous facade , the short right field porch and Monument Park , Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball 's greatest players including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Whitey Ford , Yogi Berra , Mickey Mantle , Reggie Jackson , Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera .
In the 1960 election to choose his successor , Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President , Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy . He told friends , " I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy . " He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days , although he may have done Nixon some harm . When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , Eisenhower joked , " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " Kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy . Eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as Kennedy was 43 .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
During this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( Federalists and Democratic-Republicans ) had an official leader . In 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " In 1828 , a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on Capitol Hill :
The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers , and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system . Their job was apolitical ; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law . This was very different to the 'Continental model ' of the police force that had been developed in France , where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state .
During the late 1920s and early 1930s , Eisenhower 's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat , as military priorities diminished ; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs . He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing , and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower , then a journalist at the Agriculture Department , he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe . He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928 . After a one-year assignment in France , Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely , Assistant Secretary of War , from 1929 to February 1933 . Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Industrial College ( Washington , DC ) in 1933 and later served on the faculty ( it was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy ) .
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
The great Navicella mosaic ( 1305–1313 ) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter 's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone . The giant mosaic , commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi , was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard . It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters . This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter 's in the 17th century . Navicella means " little ship " referring to the large boat which dominated the scene , and whose sail , filled by the storm , loomed over the horizon . Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art .
The centrality of the " separation " concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that " The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . "
In parts of Italy , which were under eastern artistic influences , like Sicily and Venice , mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages . The whole interior of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate , golden mosaics . The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries . The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century . One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark 's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis , a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople ( 1204 ) . The mosaics were executed in the 1220s .
The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world . Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music . In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called " kef " style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular . This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated . Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional " kef " style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of " kef music " heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time . Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia . Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry . Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan . Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent . In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .
During the Eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago ) , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . At the beginning of the period , Australia and Antarctica remained connected , and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters , distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high . But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma , the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica , and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents . The Antarctic region cooled down , and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze , sending cold water and ice floes north , reinforcing the cooling . The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago . [ citation needed ]

^Note 2 : in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows : " Article IV . Section 10 . No person within this state shall , upon any pretense , be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience , nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rate , for the building or repairing any place of worship , or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry , contrary to what he believes to be right , or hath voluntarily engaged to do . No one religious society shall ever be established in this state , in preference to another ; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles .

Punjab has the largest economy in Pakistan , contributing most to the national GDP . The province 's economy has quadrupled since 1972 . Its share of Pakistan 's GDP was 54.7 % in 2000 and 59 % as of 2010 . It is especially dominant in the service and agriculture sectors of Pakistan 's economy . With its contribution ranging from 52.1 % to 64.5 % in the Service Sector and 56.1 % to 61.5 % in the agriculture sector . It is also major manpower contributor because it has largest pool of professionals and highly skilled ( technically trained ) manpower in Pakistan . It is also dominant in the manufacturing sector , though the dominance is not as huge , with historical contributions raging from a low of 44 % to a high of 52.6 % . In 2007 , Punjab achieved a growth rate of 7.8 % and during the period 2002–03 to 2007–08 , its economy grew at a rate of between 7 % to 8 % per year . and during 2008–09 grew at 6 % against the total GDP growth of Pakistan at 4 % .
Traditionally , the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the House , with the Majority Leader as second-in-command . For instance , when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections , Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader . Despite this , Cantor and his successor , Kevin McCarthy , have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House , since Boehner is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans . However , there have been some exceptions . The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006 . In contrast , the Minority Leader is the undisputed leader of the minority party .
The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza . In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus , identified by his name in Hebrew letters . Near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . The floor was paved in 508/509 . It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon ( Menois ) and the Christian church at Shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery , located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds , hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors , and regularly organizes exhibitions . It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art . Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery , located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house , giving an important insight into Nepali history . The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu , near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg , Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent , established Nepali painters . The Nepal Art Council Gallery , located in the Babar Mahal , on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions .
Haruspicy was also used in public cult , under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate . The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice , particularly the liver . They also interpreted omens , prodigies and portents , and formulated their expiation . Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient , ethnically Etruscan " outsider " religious profession , separate from Rome 's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy , essential but never quite respectable . During the mid-to-late Republic , the reformist Gaius Gracchus , the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla , and the " notorious Verres " justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners . The senate and armies used the public haruspices : at some time during the late Republic , the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination . Being of independent means , they would be better motivated to maintain a pure , religious practice for the public good . The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect : none of this seems to have troubled Marius , who employed a Syrian prophetess .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics .
The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold . Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus . Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths . In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .
By the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state , with a large plebeian , artisan class excluded from the old patrician gentes and from the state priesthoods . The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours ; according to tradition , Rome 's Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine ; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter , Juno and Minerva , installed in a Capitoline temple , built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival , Epulum Jovis . These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned , as if noble guests , at their own inaugural banquet .

On May 1 , 1960 , a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over Soviet Union airspace . The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an East–West summit conference , which had been scheduled in Paris , 15 days later . Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil . Four days after Powers disappeared , the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had " gone missing " north of Turkey . It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged , and falsely claimed that " the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties . "
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . For example , humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
With high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . Rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( CAD ) software can be assembled by a robot . Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . But these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . With robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
The Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14 . Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern . Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta . The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96 . In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
As a consequence of his heart attack , Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm , which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25 , 1957 . This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand . The stroke had caused an aphasia . The president also suffered from Crohn 's disease , chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine , which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9 , 1956 . To treat the intestinal block , surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine . His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis . Eisenhower 's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits , but he still indulged in alcohol . During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29 , 1959 ; however , before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower " drank several gin-and-tonics , and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner " .
From the early 16th century , both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule . Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia , significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires . From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya , and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century , Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid , Afsharid and Qajar empires , while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule . In the late 1820s , the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan ( all of Eastern Armenia ) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran 's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War ( 1826-1828 ) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay . Western Armenia however , remained in Ottoman hands .
In the Regal era , a rex sacrorum ( king of the sacred rites ) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king ( rex ) or in his absence , and announced the public festivals . He had little or no civil authority . With the abolition of monarchy , the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased . By the late Republican era , the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia . The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title : his religious duties still included the daily , ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus .
Chthonic gods such as Dis pater , the di inferi ( " gods below " ) , and the collective shades of the departed ( di Manes ) were given dark , fertile victims in nighttime rituals . Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering , and there was no shared banquet , as " the living can not share a meal with the dead " . Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals ; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival . Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices . Demigods and heroes , who belonged to the heavens and the underworld , were sometimes given black-and-white victims . Robigo ( or Robigus ) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns . Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound , T. E. Hulme , and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental " slop " ( Hulme ) [ citation needed ] or " an old bitch gone in the teeth " ( Pound ) and wanted to go back to a more manly , authoritarian society such as ( they believed ) existed in the Middle Ages . Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists , such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault , have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature , which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human . " Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal " , suggests Timothy Laurie , turning the human into what he calls " a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans ( e.g . rationality , altruism ) , rather than most commonplace ( e.g . hunger , anger ) " . Nevertheless , philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals , anti-humanism thus frequently " secretes a humanist rhetoric " .
A Vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and Roman matron and wife . Unlike male priests , Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of Rome .
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen system , with two distinct seasons : the rainy season , from October to April , and a dry season , from May to September . The average temperature is 20.6 °C ( 69.1 °F ) . September , at the end of the dry season , has the highest average maximum temperature , 28.3 °C ( 82.9 °F ) , has major and minor lower maximum average temperature , of 25.1 °C ( 77.2 °F ) and 12.9 °C ( 55.2 °F ) , respectively . Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C ( 72 °F ) . With 247.4 mm ( 9.7 in ) , January is the month with the highest rainfall of the year , while June is the lowest , with only 8.7 mm ( 0.3 in ) .
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
Quakers , or Friends , are members of a family of religious movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends . The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers . Many Friends view themselves as members of a Christian denomination . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity . Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity , the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures .
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common , their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness , whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment , the nature of immortality , whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium , and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth . The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible , leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath . The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church 's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs ( 1980 and 2005 ) , which use Biblical references as justification .
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
The " religious test " clause has been interpreted to cover both elected officials and appointed ones , career civil servants as well as political appointees . Religious beliefs or the lack of them have therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution . Seven states , however , have language included in their Bill of Rights , Declaration of Rights , or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs , though some of these have been successfully challenged in court . These states are Texas , Massachusetts , Maryland , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Tennessee .
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of New York City in the state of New York , located south of Westchester County . Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River , as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens . Of the five boroughs , the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
The spread of Greek literature , mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome 's festivals and rituals , and the embellishment of its mythology . Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus , who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals . In the last century of the Republic , Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite , most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods ; notably , Scaevola and the polymath Varro . For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus ' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction ; what the people believed was not itself the truth , but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with . Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives , the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals , and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult .
Kathmandu is home to Nepali cinema and theaters . The city contains several theaters , including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path , the Ganga Theatre , the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982 . The M. Art Theater is based in the city . The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival , attracting artists from all over the world . A mini theater is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square , established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee .
Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine , mathematics , astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution . Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university , the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution . Historians such as Richard S. Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists . This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors , usually in princely courts , and associations with newly forming scientific societies .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a " place of palaces " . There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur . The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , Kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty . The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square . The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap , Kumari Ghar , and Shiva-Parvati Temple ; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace . The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 Nepal earthquake .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
In Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) , the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause . The court 's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable , " the court wrote . " Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a " wall , " is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "
In the general election , against the advice of his advisors , Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South , refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party . The campaign strategy , dubbed " K1C2 " , was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues : Korea , Communism and corruption . In an effort to accommodate the right , he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only ; he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman .
While the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . During the Punic crisis , popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy ; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with Roman Bacchus . Official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . Much later , a statue of Marsyas , the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus ' censorship . Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . Where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; Liber 's festival continued .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma . The period was a time of great tectonic activity , as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together . The continent Euramerica ( or Laurussia ) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica , which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn . In these near-deserts , the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed , made red by the oxidized iron ( hematite ) characteristic of drought conditions . Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe , further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana . The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere . Sea levels were high worldwide , and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas . The deep , enormous Panthalassa ( the " universal ocean " ) covered the rest of the planet . Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys , Proto-Tethys , Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean ( which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica ) .
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . By 1992 , with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe ( Joubert and Bevers , 1996 ) .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
In the original city plan , the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station . Because of the growth of Brasília ( and corresponding growth in the bus fleet ) , today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station ( called Rodoferroviária ) , located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental . The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station . A new bus station was opened in July 2010 . It is on Saída Sul ( South Exit ) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station , and it 's also an inter-state bus station , used only to leave the Federal District .
The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured . All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host . An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin . Neither of these colonizations are considered infections . The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance . Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions , and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection . Some colonizing bacteria , such as Corynebacteria sp . and viridans streptococci , prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host , preventing infection and speeding wound healing .
Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " I give that you might give . " Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .

Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur . The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space , and only later referred to a building . Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space ; its ancient boundary ( pomerium ) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough ; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state . In Rome , the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra ( Sacred Way ) and the pomerium . Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur , who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before , during and after an act of sacrifice . Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice , errant rites ( vitium ) or an unacceptable plan of action . If an unfavourable sign was given , the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen , consult with his augural colleagues , or abandon the project . Magistrates could use their right of augury ( ius augurum ) to adjourn and overturn the process of law , but were obliged to base their decision on the augur 's observations and advice . For Cicero , himself an augur , this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic . By his time ( mid 1st century BC ) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices , whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum .
To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow . Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America ( the Western Interior Seaway ) and Europe , then receded late in the period , leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds . At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression , one-third of Earth 's present land area was submerged . The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk ; indeed , more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic . Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather , the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium ; this made the oceans more saturated , as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton . These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine . Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas 's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation . Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China . In the area that is now India , massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene .
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian . However , the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon , and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city . Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places . Buff ( meat of water buffalo ) is very common . There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu , especially among Newars , which is not found in other parts of Nepal . Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago . Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal , pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes . A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo . The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow 's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity . The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly Momo or Chowmein .
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
Baptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and that it must be done by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or sprinkling ) . Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency ( liberty ) , salvation through faith alone , Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice , and the autonomy of the local congregation . Baptists recognize two ministerial offices , pastors and deacons . Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches , though some Baptists disavow this identity .
In 2003 , the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania . The panels depict real or fantastic animal , floral , solar and geometric representations . Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church , built some time between the 10th and 11th century . Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence . The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary .
In 1963 , the Robbins Report on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "
A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . Their powers include the legitimized use of force . The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
From 1879 , Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically . Thirty congregations were founded , and during 1879 and 1880 , Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings . As congregations continued to form during Russell 's ministry , they each remained self-administrative , functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance . In 1881 , Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley , and in 1884 , Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles . By about 1900 , Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs , and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices . By the 1910s , Russell 's organization maintained nearly a hundred " pilgrims , " or traveling preachers . Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry , and by 1912 , he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .

Kumari Ghar is a palace in the center of the Kathmandu city , next to the Durbar square where a Royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides . Kumari , or Kumari Devi , is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in South Asian countries . In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous . Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju ( the Nepali name for Durga ) until she menstruates , after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body . Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status . The current Royal Kumari , Matina Shakya , age four , was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy .
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate , Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea 's Hellenised elite . Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them . Early Italian synagogues have left few traces ; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period . Judaea 's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora ; in Rome , this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion . Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by Julius Caesar . By the Augustan era , the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews . In some periods under Roman rule , Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice , under certain conditions . Judaism was a superstitio to Cicero , but the Church Father Tertullian described it as religio licita ( an officially permitted religion ) in contrast to Christianity .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
In November 1945 , Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army . His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . However , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets , Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon . Indeed , Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese , writing , " First , the Japanese were ready to surrender and it was n't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . Second , I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " Initially , Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets . He even visited Warsaw in 1945 . Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . However , by mid-1947 , as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated , Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
Football and Cricket are the most popular sports among the younger generation in Nepal and there are several stadiums in the city . The sport is governed by the All Nepal Football Association ( ANFA ) from its headquarters in Kathmandu . The only international football stadium in the city is the Dasarath Rangasala Stadium , a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for football matches and cultural events , located in the neighborhood of Tripureshwor . It is the largest stadium in Nepal with a capacity of 25,000 spectators , built in 1956 . Martyr 's Memorial League is also held in this ground every year . The stadium was renovated with Chinese help before the 8th South Asian Games were held in Kathmandu and had floodlights installed . Kathmandu is home to the oldest football clubs of Nepal such as RCT , Sankata and NRT . Other prominent clubs include MMC , Machhindra FC , Tribhuwan Army Club ( TAC ) and MPC .
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu , near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building . This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa . It is the most important museum in the country , housing an extensive collection of weapons , art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance . The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons , and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana , meaning " the stone house of arms and ammunition " . Given its focus , the museum contains many weapons , including locally made firearms used in wars , leather cannons from the 18th–19th century , and medieval and modern works in wood , bronze , stone and paintings .
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic : opus vermiculatum used tiny tesserae , typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less , and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support . The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail , and an approach to the illusionism of painting . Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work . The normal technique was opus tessellatum , using larger tesserae , which was laid on site . There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background , which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work .
Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France . This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed , just a week before departure . Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time , despite being given the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home . [ citation needed ] In World War II , rivals who had combat service in the first great war ( led by Gen. Bernard Montgomery ) sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty , despite his stateside experience establishing a camp , completely equipped , for thousands of troops , and developing a full combat training schedule .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
Portuguese pavement ( in Portuguese , Calçada Portuguesa ) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal , and common throughout the Lusosphere . Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex , it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design . In Portuguese-speaking countries , many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even , though far more occasionally , streets done in this mosaic form . Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style .
Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of Latin , such as Cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the Greek equivalent Paideia . Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century Italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . Modern scholars , however , point out that Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . For Cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
Chthonic gods such as Dis pater , the di inferi ( " gods below " ) , and the collective shades of the departed ( di Manes ) were given dark , fertile victims in nighttime rituals . Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering , and there was no shared banquet , as " the living can not share a meal with the dead " . Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals ; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival . Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices . Demigods and heroes , who belonged to the heavens and the underworld , were sometimes given black-and-white victims . Robigo ( or Robigus ) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew .
In his book , Humanism ( 1997 ) , Tony Davies calls these critics " humanist anti-humanists " . Critics of antihumanism , most notably Jürgen Habermas , counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism 's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal , they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own . Others , like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks , but thought humanism applied only to the German " race " and specifically to the Nazis and thus , in Davies ' words , were anti-humanist humanists . Such a reading of Heidegger 's thought is itself deeply controversial ; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism . Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century " it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man ' or the 'triumph of human reason ' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them " . For " it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason " . Yet , he continues , " it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms . For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution . The freedom to speak and write , to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests , to protest and disobey : all these can only be articulated in humanist terms . "
Consistent with Calvin 's political ideas , Protestants created both the English and the American democracies . In seventeenth-century England , the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell , John Milton , John Locke , the Glorious Revolution , the English Bill of Rights , and the Act of Settlement . Later , the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies , e.g . Australia , New Zealand , and India . In North America , Plymouth Colony ( Pilgrim Fathers ; 1620 ) and Massachusetts Bay Colony ( 1628 ) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers . These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God . The Mayflower Compact was a social contract .
The city of Kathmandu is named after Kasthamandap temple , that stood in Durbar Square . In Sanskrit , Kastha ( काष्ठ ) means " wood " and Mandap ( /मण्डप ) means " covered shelter " . This temple , also known as Maru Satal in the Newar language , was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla . The two-storey structure was made entirely of wood , and used no iron nails nor supports . According to legend , all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree . The structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
After 1517 , when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available , the Dutch humanist Erasmus , who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius , began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla , comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter . Erasmus , along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples , began issuing new translations , laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Henceforth Renaissance humanism , particularly in the German North , became concerned with religion , while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists , studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith . After the Reformation , critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school .
The view of the Roman Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations can not be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas , and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession . According to Bishop Hilarion ( Alfeyev ) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject .
The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings . Unpredictable weather is expected , given that temperatures can drop to 1 °C ( 34 °F ) or less during the winter . During a 2013 cold front , the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to −4 °C ( 25 °F ) , and the lowest temperature was recorded on January 10 , 2013 , at −9.2 °C ( 15.4 °F ) . Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based ( about 65 % of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August ) , and decreases substantially ( 100 to 200 cm ( 39 to 79 in ) ) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal . Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres ( 55.1 in ) for the Kathmandu valley , and averages 1,407 millimetres ( 55.4 in ) for the city of Kathmandu . On average humidity is 75 % . The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology , " Weather Meteorology " for 2005 . The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month . The annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres ( 44.3 in ) for 2005 , as per monthly data included in the table above . The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu . This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon . [ citation needed ] For example , 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu , totalling over 2,900 mm ( 114 in ) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season . In contrast , 2001 recorded only 356 mm ( 14 in ) of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season .
The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus , inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition . Yaroslav , the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , Kiev . The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral . It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen , sent by Constantine Monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels . Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above . Below is a Communion of the Apostles .
Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co-ordinate their work , share information , and get help quickly . In recent years , vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatching of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and updating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real-time basis . Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches , whistles , police notebooks and " ticket books " or citations .
Yet another may have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related financial services ( such as mortgage loans or insurance policies ) offered in some areas of the Bronx — a process known as redlining . Others have suggested a " planned shrinkage " of municipal services , such as fire-fighting . There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable ( or more costly ) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings .
Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body , grows and multiplies . This is referred to as colonization . Most humans are not easily infected . Those who are weak , sick , malnourished , have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections . Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections . Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface , generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity , nose , eyes , genitalia , anus , or the microbe can enter through open wounds . While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry , many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs . Some pathogens grow within the host cells ( intracellular ) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate , and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site 's terms of service . In July 2008 , the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was " unimpressed " with YouTube 's system for policing its videos , and argued that " proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content " . YouTube responded by stating :
In 1953 , the Republican Party 's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch ; however , the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point . At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower 's presidency .
This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement .
Protestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation , today regarded as branches . Some of these movements have a common lineage , sometimes directly spawning individual denominations . Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations , this section discusses only the largest denominational families , or branches , widely considered to be a part of Protestantism . These are , in alphabetical order : Adventist , Anglican , Baptist , Calvinist ( Reformed ) , Lutheran , Methodist and Pentecostal . A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed .
In the immediate years after Eisenhower left office , his reputation declined . He was widely seen by critics as an inactive , uninspiring , golf-playing president compared to his vigorous young successor . Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock , Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted . Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment , for the Soviet Union 's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race , and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( crossreacting ) , or by vaccination . Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens . There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .
The Bronx 's highest elevation at 280 feet ( 85 m ) is in the northwest corner , west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School . The opposite ( southeastern ) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or " necks " of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh : Hunt 's Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck and Throg 's Neck . Further up the coastline , Rodman 's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island . The Bronx 's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles ( 194 km2 ) .
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
The small woolen dolls called Maniae , hung on the Compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania , as Mother of the Lares . The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus , traditionally Rome 's Republican founder and first consul . Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example .
Tourism is considered another important industry in Nepal . This industry started around 1950 , as the country 's political makeup changed and ended the country 's isolation from the rest of the world . In 1956 , air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway , between Kathmandu and Raxaul ( at India 's border ) , was started . Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity ; some of these include the Tourism Development Board , the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department . Furthermore , Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations . Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity . The hotel industry , travel agencies , training of tourist guides , and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal , and in Kathmandu in particular .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods : a boom period during 1900–29 , with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930 . The Great Depression and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline . The mid to late century were hard times , as the Bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty . The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today .

The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower , Nikita Khrushchev , Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident . Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev 's demands that he apologize . Therefore , Khrushchev would not take part in the summit . Up until this event , Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union . Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit . Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that " stupid U-2 business " .
Romulus was credited with several religious institutions . He founded the Consualia festival , inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate ; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus 's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome 's myth of origins . As a successful general , Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome 's first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the spolia opima , the prime spoils taken in war , in the celebration of the first Roman triumph . Spared a mortal 's death , Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of Romanitas . Rome 's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities , including their traditional gods , the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the diis deabusque omnibus ( all the gods and goddesses ) . They also brought Roman " domestic " deities and cult practices with them . By the same token , the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military .
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening . The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it , and miraculously recovered , though he had to repeat his freshman year . He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college , though they lacked the funds . They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions .
The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of God . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . They consider the Bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist Andrew Holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body , through Watch Tower Society publications , carry almost as much weight as the Bible . Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended ; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . Adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding . " The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
During the Permian all the Earth 's major land masses , except portions of East Asia , were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea . Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles , with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ( Panthalassa , the universal sea ) , and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana . The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink . A new ocean was growing on its southern end , the Tethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era . Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ( " continental climate " ) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns . Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages . The objective is to start a regular " Bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " Field Service Report " . Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive " .
The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor . The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933 , 1937 and 1941 ( and in the latter two elections , only because his 30-32 % vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22-23 % as a Republican ) . The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 . The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31 % of the Bronx 's vote , putting him second and well ahead of the 20 % won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel , who came in second ( ahead of Hillquit ) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2 % to 21.7 % .
All Protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the Church universal and generally deny the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . The various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the Bible alone ( rather than with Catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The " Five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of the day .
Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection . Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection . There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body . Some viruses once acquired never leave the body . A typical example is the herpes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
Mosaic has a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine . Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance , though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique . Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics .
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
The enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu . " Narayanhity " comes from Narayana , a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu , and Hiti , meaning " water spout " ( Vishnu 's temple is located opposite the palace , and the water spout is located east of the main entrance to the precinct ) . Narayanhity was a new palace , in front of the old palace built in 1915 , and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary Pagoda . It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah , then heir apparent to the throne . The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads . The palace area covers ( 30 hectares ( 74 acres ) ) and is fully secured with gates on all sides . This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre . After the fall of the monarchy , it was converted to a museum .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .
Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials . They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas , once common in the Eastern Mediterranean . The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham 's Palace , Palestine which was made around 744 . The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer ( right side ) and two deers peacefully grazing ( left side ) . The panel probably represents good and bad governance . Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar , Lebanon . The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat ( in present-day Jordan ) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill . The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by " good " animals on one side and " bad " animals on the other . Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls , grapes , pomegranates , oryx , wolves , hares , a leopard , pairs of partridges , fish , bulls , ostriches , rabbits , rams , goats , lions and a snake . At Qastal , near Amman , excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan , dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ( 685–705 ) . They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor . The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns , trees , animals , fruits and rosettes . Except for the open courtyard , entrance and staircases , the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics .
Each of Rome 's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic . Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests . The first " outsider " Etruscan king , Lucius Tarquinius Priscus , founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter , Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world . The benevolent , divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League , its Aventine Temple to Diana , and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms . Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus , whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates .
Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages . The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower 's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency . Meanwhile , Columbia University 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including Leonard McCollum , the president of Continental Oil ; Frank Abrams , the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey ; Bob Kleberg , the president of the King Ranch ; H. J. Porter , a Texas oil executive ; Bob Woodruff , the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation ; and Clarence Francis , the chairman of General Foods .
Among Ike 's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) into McCarthy 's witch hunt for communists , which would interfere with , and perhaps delay , the AEC 's important work on H-bombs . The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC , J. Robert Oppenheimer , had urged that the H-bomb work be delayed . Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance , though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy .
A series of low-lying annexes ( largely hidden ) flank both ends . Also in the square are the glass-faced Planalto Palace housing the presidential offices , and the Palace of the Supreme Court . Farther east , on a triangle of land jutting into the lake , is the Palace of the Dawn ( Palácio da Alvorada ; the presidential residence ) . Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city 's cathedral , considered by many to be Niemeyer 's finest achievement ( see photographs of the interior ) . The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports , which join in a circle 115 feet ( 35 meters ) above the floor of the nave ; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass . The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways . Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace , Itamaraty Palace , the National Theater , and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture . The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings .
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . Among these groups , many Irish Americans , Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here . In addition , French , German , Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . The Jewish population also increased notably during this time . In 1937 , according to Jewish organizations , 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011 . Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate , and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site 's terms of service . In July 2008 , the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was " unimpressed " with YouTube 's system for policing its videos , and argued that " proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content " . YouTube responded by stating :
His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading . Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children , and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline , usually from David . His mother , previously a member ( with David ) of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites , joined the International Bible Students Association , later known as Jehovah 's Witnesses . The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 , though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students . His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother , who felt that warfare was " rather wicked , " but she did not overrule him . While speaking of himself in 1948 , Eisenhower said he was " one of the most deeply religious men I know " though unattached to any " sect or organization " . He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953 .
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty . A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064 . They settled in large numbers in Cilicia , an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times . In 1080 , they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia , which became the focus of Armenian nationalism . The Armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby Crusader States , but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions . In the next few centuries , Djenghis Khan , Timurids , and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians .
Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's " Rational Clinical Examination Series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11-20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64-0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64-0.88 ) .
In many ways , the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period . During the Paleocene , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents . Europe and Greenland were still connected . North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge , while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate . The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west , which ended in the succeeding epoch . South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas ( they joined during the Neogene ) ; the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart , with Africa , South America , Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other . Africa was heading north toward Europe , slowly closing the Tethys Ocean , and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas .
The city of Kathmandu is named after Kasthamandap temple , that stood in Durbar Square . In Sanskrit , Kastha ( काष्ठ ) means " wood " and Mandap ( /मण्डप ) means " covered shelter " . This temple , also known as Maru Satal in the Newar language , was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla . The two-storey structure was made entirely of wood , and used no iron nails nor supports . According to legend , all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree . The structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
On November 6 , 2013 , Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented . The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments . They give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . In response , YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question " why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island , Chase Melvin noted that " Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who do n't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system " . In the same article Melvin goes on to say :
Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , Armenia was an independent republic . In late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army , and in 1922 , Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union , later forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 1936 to September 21 , 1991 ) . In 1991 , Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia .
Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired . Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans , while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism . In selecting a Chief Justice , Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives , noting privately that Warren " represents the kind of political , economic , and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court ... He has a national name for integrity , uprightness , and courage that , again , I believe we need on the Court " . In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court .
^Note 2 : in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows : " Article IV . Section 10 . No person within this state shall , upon any pretense , be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience , nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rate , for the building or repairing any place of worship , or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry , contrary to what he believes to be right , or hath voluntarily engaged to do . No one religious society shall ever be established in this state , in preference to another ; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles . "
Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah’s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines .
Robert N. Bellah has in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States . He used the term " Civil Religion " to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States . His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy : " Considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word 'God ' at all ? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . "
After the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite in 1957 , Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA , which led to the space race . During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Eisenhower condemned the Israeli , British and French invasion of Egypt , and forced them to withdraw . He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action . In 1958 , Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution . Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident . In his January 17 , 1961 farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending , particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers , and coined the term " military–industrial complex " .
Despite popular conceptions promoted by movies and television , many US police departments prefer not to maintain officers in non-patrol bureaus and divisions beyond a certain period of time , such as in the detective bureau , and instead maintain policies that limit service in such divisions to a specified period of time , after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties . [ citation needed ] This is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats , prevent crime by their presence , respond to crimes in progress , manage crises , and practice their skills .

Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers . Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards . It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk , sugar and spices . Alcohol is widely drunk , and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages . Drinking and driving is illegal , and authorities have a zero tolerance policy . Ailaa and thwon ( alcohol made from rice ) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu , found in all the local bhattis ( alcohol serving eateries ) . Chhyaang , tongba ( fermented millet or barley ) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu . However , shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of Romanitas . Rome 's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities , including their traditional gods , the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the diis deabusque omnibus ( all the gods and goddesses ) . They also brought Roman " domestic " deities and cult practices with them . By the same token , the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military .
Russell moved the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters to Brooklyn , New York , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel . He identified the religious movement as " Bible Students , " and more formally as the International Bible Students Association . By 1910 , about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re-elected him annually as their " pastor . " Russell died October 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays . Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal , which can be detected by some form of instrumentation . Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen . To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases , immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent . For example , immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle . Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism 's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus .
Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
Several versions of a semi-official , structured pantheon were developed during the political , social and religious instability of the Late Republican era . Jupiter , the most powerful of all gods and " the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested " , consistently personified the divine authority of Rome 's highest offices , internal organization and external relations . During the archaic and early Republican eras , he shared his temple , some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus , who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva . A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres , Liber and Libera , and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult . Other major and minor deities could be single , coupled , or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure . These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic , part philosophical creations , and often Greek in origin . The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians , and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage .
During the Early Modern period ( approximately late 15th century to 1800 ) , the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth , productivity and innovative research . At the end of the Middle Ages , about 400 years after the first university was founded , there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe . In the 15th century , twenty-eight new ones were created , with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625 . This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe , with the highest concentrations in the German Empire ( 34 ) , Italian countries ( 26 ) , France ( 25 ) , and Spain ( 23 ) – this was close to a 500 % increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages . This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared , or institutions that merged with other universities during this time . It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period , as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions . In fact , the term " university " was not always used to designate a higher education institution . In Mediterranean countries , the term studium generale was still often used , while " Academy " was common in Northern European countries .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime-free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .
The style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the White House , the general political climate in the House , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . Despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . Many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book . Others have devolved upon the position in other ways . To be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him or her as a Representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas , allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses . Mosaic murals , benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smoother and more even surface .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
Between 1975 and 2009 , Olympic Airways ( known after 2003 as Olympic Airlines ) was the country’s state-owned flag carrier , but financial problems led to its privatization and relaunch as Olympic Air in 2009 . Both Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air have won awards for their services ; in 2009 and 2011 , Aegean Airlines was awarded the " Best regional airline in Europe " award by Skytrax , and also has two gold and one silver awards by the ERA , while Olympic Air holds one silver ERA award for " Airline of the Year " as well as a " Condé Nast Traveller 2011 Readers Choice Awards : Top Domestic Airline " award .
YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005 . The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in September 2005 . Following a $ 3.5 million investment from Sequoia Capital in November , the site launched officially on December 15 , 2005 , by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day . The site grew rapidly , and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day , and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day . According to data published by market research company comScore , YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States , with a market share of around 43 % and more than 14 billion views of videos in May 2010 .
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent . Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a microbe in a community , and other epidemiological considerations . Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism , but in 380 under Theodosius I , Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire . Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus ( d. 402 ) were rejected . Christianity became increasingly popular . Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution , but Rome 's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms , and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions .
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
On November 6 , 2013 , Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented . The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments . They give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . In response , YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question " why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island , Chase Melvin noted that " Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who do n't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system " . In the same article Melvin goes on to say :
Regardless of the way the tension between universities , individual scientists , and the scientific revolution itself is perceived , there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed . Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction , but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting . The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution , and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation , initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines . Instead of entering higher education to become a " general scholar " immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum , there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself . The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge .
The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower , Nikita Khrushchev , Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident . Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev 's demands that he apologize . Therefore , Khrushchev would not take part in the summit . Up until this event , Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union . Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit . Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that " stupid U-2 business " .
Institute of Medicine , the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is located in Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . It was established in 1972 and started to impart medical education from 1978 . A number of medical colleges including Kathmandu Medical College , Nepal Medical College , KIST Medical College , Nepal Army Institute of Health Sciences , National Academy of Medical Sciences ( NAMS ) and Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences ( KUSMS ) , are also located in or around Kathmandu .
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .
The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the United States , the 15th , but its wide diversity also includes affluent , upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale , Fieldston , Spuyten Duyvil , Schuylerville , Pelham Bay , Pelham Gardens , Morris Park and Country Club . The Bronx , particularly the South Bronx , saw a sharp decline in population , livable housing , and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s , culminating in a wave of arson . Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace in the 1990s into today .
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries , including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal . Nepal 's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions , Hinduism and Buddhhism . These are amply reflected in the many temples , shrines , stupas , monasteries , and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur . The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day , including archeological exportation .
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 . In November 2008 , YouTube reached an agreement with MGM , Lions Gate Entertainment , and CBS , allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site , accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called " Shows " . The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu , which features material from NBC , Fox , and Disney . In November 2009 , YouTube launched a version of " Shows " available to UK viewers , offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners . In January 2010 , YouTube introduced an online film rentals service , which is available only to users in the US , Canada and the UK as of 2010 . The service offers over 6,000 films .
The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park , which includes Orchard Beach—and the fourth largest , Van Cortlandt Park , which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers . Also in the northern Bronx , Wave Hill , the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house , gardens , changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale . Nearer the borough 's center , and along the Bronx River , is Bronx Park ; its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens , which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire county , and its southern end the Bronx Zoo , the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States . Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir , surrounded by 2 miles ( 3 km ) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood ; the reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack . Further south is Crotona Park , home to a 3.3-acre ( 1.3 ha ) lake , 28 species of trees , and a large swimming pool . The land for these parks , and many others , was bought by New York City in 1888 , while land was still open and inexpensive , in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development .
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .
Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " I give that you might give . " Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .
The rediscovery of Aristotle 's works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated –fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history . Richard Dales , for instance , calls the discovery of Aristotle 's works " a turning point in the history of Western thought . " After Aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in Latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . The efforts of this " scholasticism " were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason . This became the primary mission of lecturers , and the expectation of students .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day . By the end of the Mesozoic era , the continents had rifted into nearly their present form . Laurasia became North America and Eurasia , while Gondwana split into South America , Africa , Australia , Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent , which collided with the Asian plate . This impact gave rise to the Himalayas . The Tethys Sea , which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India , began to close up , forming the Mediterranean sea .
The view of the Roman Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations can not be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas , and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession . According to Bishop Hilarion ( Alfeyev ) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject .
The name Anabaptist , meaning " one who baptizes again " , was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants . Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants . The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist , claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void , the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism . As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues , Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics . [ aa ] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount , which precluded taking oaths , participating in military actions , and participating in civil government , some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise . [ ab ] They were thus technically Anabaptists , even though conservative Amish , Mennonites , and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism . Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front . Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden , Thomas Müntzer , Kaspar Schwenkfeld , Sebastian Franck , Menno Simons . Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck , Conrad Grebel , Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co-ordinate their work , share information , and get help quickly . In recent years , vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatching of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and updating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real-time basis . Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches , whistles , police notebooks and " ticket books " or citations .
Eisenhower , as well as the officers and troops under him , had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations , and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault . His first struggles , however , were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion ; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord . Admiral Ernest J . King fought with Eisenhower over King 's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific . He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord , to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented , as he did . Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter 's concern with civilian casualties ; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans , and Eisenhower prevailed . He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton , by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate , and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
Penny Marshall 's 1990 film Awakenings , which was nominated for several Oscars , is based on neurologist Oliver Sacks ' 1973 account of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of encephalitis but briefly responded to the drug L-dopa . Robin Williams played the physician ; Robert De Niro was one of the patients who emerged from a catatonic ( frozen ) state . The home of Williams ' character was shot not far from Sacks ' actual City Island residence . A 1973 Yorkshire Television documentary and " A Kind of Alaska " , a 1985 play by Harold Pinter , were also based on Sacks ' book .
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
In the early stages of the First Punic War ( 264 BC ) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat . The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . Even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
The Plymouth Brethren are a conservative , low church , evangelical movement , whose history can be traced to Dublin , Ireland , in the late 1820s , originating from Anglicanism . Among other beliefs , the group emphasizes sola scriptura . Brethren generally see themselves not as a denomination , but as a network , or even as a collection of overlapping networks , of like-minded independent churches . Although the group refused for many years to take any denominational name to itself—a stance that some of them still maintain—the title The Brethren , is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as brethren .
During the French Revolution , and soon after , in Germany ( by the Left Hegelians ) , humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind , without attention to the transcendent or supernatural . The designation Religious Humanism refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . It is similar to Protestantism , although centered on human needs , interests , and abilities rather than the supernatural . In the Anglophone world , such modern , organized forms of humanism , which are rooted in the 18th-century Enlightenment , have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts .
There are several major exceptions on tuition fees . In many European countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . Public universities in Nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . Denmark , Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . Citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
Steven Waldman notes that ; " The evangelicals provided the political muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson , not merely because they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep the spiritual and secular worlds apart . " " Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners , " writes the historian Frank Lambert in his book The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America . " New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state . "
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Baptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and that it must be done by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or sprinkling ) . Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency ( liberty ) , salvation through faith alone , Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice , and the autonomy of the local congregation . Baptists recognize two ministerial offices , pastors and deacons . Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches , though some Baptists disavow this identity .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
A series of low-lying annexes ( largely hidden ) flank both ends . Also in the square are the glass-faced Planalto Palace housing the presidential offices , and the Palace of the Supreme Court . Farther east , on a triangle of land jutting into the lake , is the Palace of the Dawn ( Palácio da Alvorada ; the presidential residence ) . Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city 's cathedral , considered by many to be Niemeyer 's finest achievement ( see photographs of the interior ) . The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports , which join in a circle 115 feet ( 35 meters ) above the floor of the nave ; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass . The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways . Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace , Itamaraty Palace , the National Theater , and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture . The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings .
Kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . The average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley : south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City ( Patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by Kirtipur Municipality and to the east by Madyapur Thimi Municipality . To the north the urban area extends into several Village Development Committees . However , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley .
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
On January 17 , 1961 , Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office . In his farewell speech , Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces . He described the Cold War : " We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ... " and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that " we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military–industrial complex . "
Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 . Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan 's nuclear program such as Kahuta . It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi . The peace process between India and Pakistan , which began in earnest in 2004 , has helped pacify the situation . Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common . Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term , but as with other decisions , he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again . During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 , he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP 's potential candidates ; the group , in addition to his doctor , concluded a second term was well advised , and he announced in February 1956 he would run again . Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon 's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket ; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition . He personally favored Robert B. Anderson , a Democrat , who rejected his offer ; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party . In 1956 , Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide , with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6 % of the popular vote . The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
All Protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the Church universal and generally deny the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . The various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the Bible alone ( rather than with Catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The " Five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of the day .
The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .

The second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . Though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers . Because sola scriptura placed the Bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between Christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was Christocentric .
The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet , stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible , and that it has not claimed its predictions were " the words of Jehovah . " George D. Chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 , 1925 and 1975 , the changing views and dates of the Jehovah 's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions . Chryssides further states , " it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the Witnesses as a group that continues to set a single end-date that fails and then devise a new one , as many counter-cultists do . " However , sociologist Andrew Holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago , " Witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time . "
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from God , and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements . They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed . Jehovah 's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " The Witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah 's approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan . Witnesses are taught that association with " worldly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality .
The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians ; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic , and the proprietors of Perth Amboy , New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers . The Province of West Jersey had declared , in 1681 , that there should be no religious test for office . An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope , which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution . That law was replaced by 1799 .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago . Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the Holocene . In addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene , and are still rising today . The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea . Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont , Quebec , Ontario and Michigan . Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin . Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea , including much of Finland . The region continues to rise , still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe . The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger , immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase , to near its present boundaries .
According to the 2009 American Community Survey , White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth ( 22.9 % ) of the Bronx 's population . However , non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth ( 12.1 % ) of the population , down from 34.4 % in 1980 . Out of all five boroughs , the Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents . 320,640 whites called the Bronx home , of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites . The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent . People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9 % of the population . People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1 % of the population . German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4 % and 0.8 % of the population respectively .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
Jeffries and Ryan ( 2001 ) argue that the modern concept of separation of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court . The central point , they argue , was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools , followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education . Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause .
The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor . The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933 , 1937 and 1941 ( and in the latter two elections , only because his 30-32 % vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22-23 % as a Republican ) . The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 . The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31 % of the Bronx 's vote , putting him second and well ahead of the 20 % won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel , who came in second ( ahead of Hillquit ) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2 % to 21.7 % .
After the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite in 1957 , Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA , which led to the space race . During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Eisenhower condemned the Israeli , British and French invasion of Egypt , and forced them to withdraw . He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action . In 1958 , Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution . Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident . In his January 17 , 1961 farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending , particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers , and coined the term " military–industrial complex " .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
The metro leaves the Rodoviária ( bus station ) and goes south , avoiding most of the political and tourist areas . The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities , such as Samambaia , Taguatinga and Ceilândia , as well as Guará and Águas Claras . The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself ( the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants , Taguatinga had 243,575 , whereas the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants ) , and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation .
In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced : some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred . Others complied . Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian , but powerful and influential ; and some provincial authorities were lenient , notably the Caesar in Gaul , Constantius Chlorus , the father of Constantine I. Diocletian 's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311 , when he asked Christians to pray for him . " This meant an ofﬁcial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire , although one of the tetrarchs , Maximinus Daia , still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313 . "
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
But in the mid-18th century , during the French Enlightenment , a more ideological use of the term had come into use . In 1765 , the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of " The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us , and which we will venture to call 'humanism ' , for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing " . The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots " philanthropic " and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge ( some Christian , some not ) . After the French Revolution , the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions , attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau , was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives , such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre , as a deification or idolatry of humanity . Humanism began to acquire a negative sense . The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word " humanism " by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the " mere humanity " ( as opposed to the divine nature ) of Christ , i.e. , Unitarians and Deists . In this polarised atmosphere , in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise , universal schooling , and the like , liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity . The anarchist Proudhon ( best known for declaring that " property is theft " ) used the word " humanism " to describe a " culte , déification de l’humanité " ( " worship , deification of humanity " ) and Ernest Renan in L’avenir de la science : pensées de 1848 ( " The Future of Knowledge : Thoughts on 1848 " ) ( 1848–49 ) , states : " It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future , that is , the cult of all that pertains to humanity—all of life , sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value . "
The Abbot of Monte Cassino , Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church . According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse , the arch and the vestibule of the basilica . Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds ( now in the Monte Cassino Museum ) . " The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts " – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy .
Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life , and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948 . He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game , to the point of golfing during winter ; he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground . He had a small , basic golf facility installed at Camp David , and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts , inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions . Roberts , an investment broker , also handled the Eisenhower family 's investments . Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs , which proved financially lucrative .
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
Many scholars ( including Makdisi ) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus , the Emirate of Sicily , and the Middle East ( during the Crusades ) . Other scholars see this argument as overstated . Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education , turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context .
There are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos ( 1122–34 ) . The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name , Piroska shows . The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier ( from 1122 ) is similarly personal . The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty , the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed . The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent . There is only a " Communion of the Apostles " in the apse of the cathedral of Serres .
Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD , when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet . This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature . Early Armenian literature was written by the " father of Armenian history " , Moses of Chorene , who authored The History of Armenia . The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD . The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature . This period of time , during which Armenian culture flourished , is known as the Revival period ( Zartonki sherchan ) . The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis , almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe , were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism . Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience , and preferred them over classical Armenian ( grabar ) . This period ended after the Hamidian massacres , when Armenians experienced turbulent times . As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed , writers like Paruyr Sevak , Gevork Emin , Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature .
Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual ; in effect they were Rome in miniature . The commander 's headquarters stood at the centre ; he took the auspices on a dais in front . A small building behind housed the legionary standards , the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era , the image of the ruling emperor . In one camp , this shrine is even called Capitolium . The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major , set battle . A ram , a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded , led around the outer perimeter of the camp ( a lustratio exercitus ) and in through a gate , then sacrificed : Trajan 's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars . The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum ; all within are purified and protected .
Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled , working-class , urban culture . Hollywood films such as From This Day Forward ( 1946 ) , set in Highbridge , occasionally delved into Bronx life . Paddy Chayefsky 's Academy Award-winning Marty was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film The Catered Affair , and in the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri film , A Bronx Tale , Spike Lee 's 1999 movie Summer of Sam , centered in an Italian-American Bronx community , 1994 's I Like It Like That that takes place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx , and Doughboys , the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother 's gambling debts .
With the initial investment of £4,200 , the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades , of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and " on the game . " The force was a success after its first year , and his men had " established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives . " Word of this success spread quickly , and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800 , transforming it from a private to public police agency ; now the oldest police force in the world . Colquhoun published a book on the experiment , The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames . It found receptive audiences far outside London , and inspired similar forces in other cities , notably , New York City , Dublin , and Sydney .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
During the French Revolution , and soon after , in Germany ( by the Left Hegelians ) , humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind , without attention to the transcendent or supernatural . The designation Religious Humanism refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . It is similar to Protestantism , although centered on human needs , interests , and abilities rather than the supernatural . In the Anglophone world , such modern , organized forms of humanism , which are rooted in the 18th-century Enlightenment , have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts .
The terms international policing , transnational policing , and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) , ( Sheptycki , 1995 ) . These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that , in some sense , transcend national borders . This includes a variety of practices , but international police cooperation , criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation-states , and police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention .
Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of " separation of church and state " , or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment . Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution , while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified . These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers . Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts , and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence , which references the idea of a " Creator " and " Nature 's God " , though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a " Creator " or " Nature 's God . "
Eliot and her circle , who included her companion George Henry Lewes ( the biographer of Goethe ) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau , were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte , whom Martineau had translated . Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity ( which worshiped the dead , since most humans who have ever lived are dead ) , complete with holidays and liturgy , modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism . Although Comte 's English followers , like Eliot and Martineau , for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system , they liked the idea of a religion of humanity . Comte 's austere vision of the universe , his injunction to " vivre pour altrui " ( " live for others " , from which comes the word " altruism " ) , and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy .
In the United States , their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties . Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference , the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service , the right of patients to refuse medical treatment , and the right to engage in public discourse . Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada .
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous animistic practices of Nepal . It is practiced by Kirat people . Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs , such as ancestor worship ( worship of Ajima ) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin . Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats , such as Pashupatinath , Wanga Akash Bhairabh ( Yalambar ) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu . Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice Mundhum in the city .
The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris , then the largest city in Europe . The royal edict , registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15 , 1667 created the office of lieutenant général de police ( " lieutenant general of police " ) , who was to be the head of the new Paris police force , and defined the task of the police as " ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals , purging the city of what may cause disturbances , procuring abundance , and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties " .
In some countries , YouTube is completely blocked , either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest , the run-up to an election , or in response to upcoming political anniversaries . In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open , but access to specific videos is blocked . In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video , YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
Official cults were state funded as a " matter of public interest " ( res publica ) . Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . The difference between public and private cult is often unclear . Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . Some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole . All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and pontifices .
In 1948 , Eisenhower became President of Columbia University , an Ivy League university in New York City . The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction . During that year Eisenhower 's memoir , Crusade in Europe , was published . Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs , and it was a major financial success as well . Eisenhower 's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer , but rather , marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences , and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $ 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate . This ruling saved Eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
In 2003 , the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania . The panels depict real or fantastic animal , floral , solar and geometric representations . Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church , built some time between the 10th and 11th century . Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence . The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary .
The view of the Roman Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations can not be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas , and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession . According to Bishop Hilarion ( Alfeyev ) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways ' in his honor . It was inspired in part by Eisenhower 's own Army experiences in World War II , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . Commemorative signs reading " Eisenhower Interstate System " and bearing Eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System . Several highways are also named for him , including the Eisenhower Expressway ( Interstate 290 ) near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver .
The spread of Greek literature , mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome 's festivals and rituals , and the embellishment of its mythology . Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus , who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals . In the last century of the Republic , Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite , most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods ; notably , Scaevola and the polymath Varro . For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus ' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction ; what the people believed was not itself the truth , but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with . Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives , the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals , and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult .
Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill , George S. Patton , George Marshall , and General Montgomery during World War II . Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur , and that a positive relationship endured . While in Manila , Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully . Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 . He also learned to fly , making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot 's license in 1939 at Fort Lewis . Also around this time , he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government , namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur , to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned , now named Quezon City , but he declined the offer .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Islamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire . In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art . During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world , although tile was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration .
In 1566 , the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited . By the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . On July 9 , 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order . In 1808 , the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil , because of the French invasion of Portugal . King João VI established the " Intendência Geral de Polícia " ( General Police Intendancy ) for investigations . He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809 . In 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 .
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war . Believing that a general should not participate in politics , one author later wrote that " figuratively speaking , [ Eisenhower ] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office " . As others asked him about his political future , Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job " from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe " , and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions . In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired , the president would help the general win the 1948 election , and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower 's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination .
In addition , the minority leader has a number of other institutional functions . For instance , the minority leader is sometimes statutorily authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities ; he or she and the majority leader each name three Members to serve as Private Calendar objectors ; he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening the House per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent adjournment resolutions ; he or she is a traditional member of the House Office Building Commission ; he or she is a member of the United States Capitol Preservation Commission ; and he or she may , after consultation with the Speaker , convene an early organizational party caucus or conference . Informally , the minority leader maintains ties with majority party leaders to learn about the schedule and other House matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as feasible .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article , " Preventive police " in the London Review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . The reason , argued Chadwick , was that " A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation . " In contrast to a deterrent of punishment , a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - " crime does n't pay " . In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act , the " object " of the new Metropolitan Police , was changed by Robert Peel to the " principal object , " which was the " prevention of crime . " Later historians would attribute the perception of England 's " appearance of orderliness and love of public order " to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel 's police system .
In the early stages of the First Punic War ( 264 BC ) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat . The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . Even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas , garnering little criticism , though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment . The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation . Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology ( the doctrine of how the church as a body works ) , they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers , compared to the Catholics ' idea that certain people within the church , or ideas that were old enough , had a special status in giving understanding of the text .
At the end of May 1942 , Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold , commanding general of the Army Air Forces , to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England , Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney . He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment , stating he had an " uneasy feeling " about Chaney and his staff . On June 23 , 1942 , he returned to London as Commanding General , European Theater of Operations ( ETOUSA ) , based in London and with a house on Coombe , Kingston upon Thames , and replaced Chaney . He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7 .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
Valerian 's first religious edict singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult , outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome 's traditional gods . His second edict acknowledged a Christian threat to the Imperial system – not yet at its heart but close to it , among Rome’s equites and Senators . Christian apologists interpreted his disgraceful capture and death as divine judgement . The next forty years were peaceful ; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile , due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence . Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius ' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a “pagan” basis in Christian heresies . The Christian churches were disunited ; Paul of Samosata , Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 for " dogmatic reasons – his doctrine on the human nature of Christ was rejected – and for his lifestyle , which reminded his brethren of the habits of the administrative elite " . The reasons for his deposition were widely circulated among the churches . Meanwhile , Aurelian ( 270-75 ) appealed for harmony among his soldiers ( concordia militum ) , stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official , Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome 's Campus Martius .
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers . According to Gopalraj Vansawali , a genealogy of Nepali monarchs , the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas , Mahispalas , Aabhirs , Kirants , and Somavanshi . The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber . During the Kirata era , a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu . In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages , Kathmandu is still called Yambu . Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu , near Manjupattan . During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler , Jitedasti , Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu .
Besides being the political center , Brasília is an important economic center . Brasília has the highest city gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 99.5 billion reais representing 3.76 % of the total Brazilian GDP . The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function . Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District . Being a city registered by UNESCO , the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software , film , video , and gemology among others , with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance , preserving the city property .
In 1913 the Zliten mosaic , a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests , hunting and everyday life , was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten . In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna , Libya , uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD . The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer , four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground , and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue , staring at his slain opponent . The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa . The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a " masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii . "
Jefferson 's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity , but this was a caricature . In setting up the University of Virginia , Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own , though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity , arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom . Some have argued that this arrangement was " fully compatible with Jefferson 's views on the separation of church and state ; " however , others point to Jefferson 's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation . Still other scholars , such as Mark David Hall , attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history
Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely , particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany . They included nonconformists like the Puritans , who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England . Despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches . The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established Church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .
The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( Tennessee Constitution Article IX , Section 2 is one such example . ) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me God . " In some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . At one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
The roles and responsibilities of the minority leader are not well-defined . To a large extent , the functions of the minority leader are defined by tradition and custom . A minority leader from 1931 to 1939 , Representative Bertrand Snell , R-N.Y. , provided this " job description " : " He is spokesman for his party and enunciates its policies . He is required to be alert and vigilant in defense of the minority 's rights . It is his function and duty to criticize constructively the policies and programs of the majority , and to this end employ parliamentary tactics and give close attention to all proposed legislation . "
The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor . The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933 , 1937 and 1941 ( and in the latter two elections , only because his 30-32 % vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22-23 % as a Republican ) . The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 . The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31 % of the Bronx 's vote , putting him second and well ahead of the 20 % won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel , who came in second ( ahead of Hillquit ) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2 % to 21.7 % .
A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous ; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian . There was also a drop in south polar temperatures ; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period , though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not . These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics , where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers . A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction , one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard . This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period .
Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine , mathematics , astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution . Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university , the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution . Historians such as Richard S. Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists . This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors , usually in princely courts , and associations with newly forming scientific societies .
The Taragaon Museum presents the modern history of the Kathmandu Valley . It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley , documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century . The actual structure of the Museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu . It was designed by Carl Pruscha ( master-planner of the Kathmandy Valley ) in 1970 and constructed in 1971 . Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon hostel into the Taragaon Museum . The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements , as well as the use of circle , triangles and squares . The Museum is within a short walk from the Boudhnath stupa , which itself can be seen from the Museum tower .
Larry Christenson , a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro , California , did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans . A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in Minneapolis . Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential ; especially " Hosanna ! " in Lakeville , and North Heights in St. Paul . The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the Alliance of Renewal Churches . There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach . Richard A. Jensen 's Touched by the Spirit published in 1974 , played a major role of the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Subsequent to this decision , the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause , known as the " Lemon Test " . First , the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose . Second , the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . Third , the statute or policy must not result in an " excessive entanglement " of government with religion . ( The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools , and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church 's religious mission , thus the policy involved the state in an " excessive entanglement " with religion . ) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause .
The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism , but in 380 under Theodosius I , Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire . Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus ( d. 402 ) were rejected . Christianity became increasingly popular . Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution , but Rome 's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms , and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions .
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes . There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome . During the Roman Republic ( 509–27 BC ) , the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs . Priests married , raised families , and led politically active lives . Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul . The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order , thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny . The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods , especially Jupiter , who embodied just rule . As a result of the Punic Wars ( 264–146 BC ) , when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power , many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success .
In the course of this religious upheaval , the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 swept through the Bavarian , Thuringian and Swabian principalities . After the Eighty Years ' War in the Low Countries and the French Wars of Religion , the confessional division of the states of the Holy Roman Empire eventually erupted in the Thirty Years ' War between 1618 and 1648 . It devastated much of Germany , killing between 25 % and 40 % of its population . The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , were :
In 1899 , the memorial , by the Berlin sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter ( 1846–1917 ) , finally came to rest , although subject to repeated vandalism , in the Bronx , at 164th Street and the Grand Concourse , or Joyce Kilmer Park near today 's Yankee Stadium . ( In 1999 , it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse . ) In 2007 , Christopher Gray of The New York Times described it as " a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei , the mythical German figure , surrounded by mermaids , dolphins and seashells . "
In the United States , August Vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . O.W . Wilson , a student of Vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita , Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . Strategies employed by O.W . Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . During the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
The development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between New England and New York ( Manhattan ) . Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule . Kingsbridge , built in 1693 where Broadway reached the Spuyten Duyvil Creek , was a possession of Frederick Philipse , lord of Philipse Manor . The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek . In 1759 , the farmers led by Jacobus Dyckman and Benjamin Palmer built a " free bridge " across the Harlem River which led to the abandonment of tolls altogether .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community . Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta 's flame . The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home . Besides their own festival of Vestalia , they participated directly in the rites of Parilia , Parentalia and Fordicidia . Indirectly , they played a role in every official sacrifice ; among their duties was the preparation of the mola salsa , the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation .
Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . The agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping . With 18 million international tourists in 2013 , Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world . The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world , with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
After fourteen consecutive years of economic growth , Greece went into recession in 2008 . By the end of 2009 , the Greek economy faced the highest budget deficit and government debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU . After several upward revisions , the 2009 budget deficit is now estimated at 15.7 % of GDP . This , combined with rapidly rising debt levels ( 127.9 % of GDP in 2009 ) led to a precipitous increase in borrowing costs , effectively shutting Greece out of the global financial markets and resulting in a severe economic crisis .
The agglomeration of Kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . The urban area of the Kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . They have the three highest population densities in the country . Within the districts lie VDCs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( Bhaktapur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( Lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( Kathmandu ) . Some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , Gonggabu VDC notably recorded a density over 20,000 people/km2 . ( 2011 census ) . The following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 . In November 2006 , it was bought by Google for US $ 1.65 billion . YouTube now operates as one of Google 's subsidiaries . The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries , including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal . Nepal 's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions , Hinduism and Buddhhism . These are amply reflected in the many temples , shrines , stupas , monasteries , and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur . The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day , including archeological exportation .
While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948 , actual implementation had been slow . Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953 , saying " I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia , including the Federal Government , and any segregation in the Armed Forces " . When he encountered opposition from the services , he used government control of military spending to force the change through , stating " Wherever Federal Funds are expended ... , I do not see how any American can justify ... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds " .
A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious , miniature mosaic icons . In these icons the small tesserae ( with sides of 1 mm or less ) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel . These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion . The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century . The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle , humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century .
Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill , George S. Patton , George Marshall , and General Montgomery during World War II . Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur , and that a positive relationship endured . While in Manila , Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully . Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 . He also learned to fly , making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot 's license in 1939 at Fort Lewis . Also around this time , he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government , namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur , to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned , now named Quezon City , but he declined the offer .
In parts of Italy , which were under eastern artistic influences , like Sicily and Venice , mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages . The whole interior of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate , golden mosaics . The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries . The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century . One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark 's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis , a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople ( 1204 ) . The mosaics were executed in the 1220s .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube , and concluded that while the system was " surprisingly resilient " in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos , it was not infallible . The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases , as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use . If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID , it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision . YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site 's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length .
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . Some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia , and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber . Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the Bona Dea rites .
In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 7.2 % it accounted for in 2006 , but still below the EU average of 10 % in 2008 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . In 2013 and for several months , Greece produced more than 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement . Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots , it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles . From there it spread around the world , carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there . These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history , such as seen in the two Great Awakenings . Pentecostalism , which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations , continues to be an important force in Western Christianity .
Despite its tropical wet and dry climate , extensive irrigation makes it a rich agricultural region . Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world . Wheat and cotton are the largest crops . Other crops include rice , sugarcane , millet , corn , oilseeds , pulses , vegetables , and fruits such as kinoo . Livestock and poultry production are also important . Despite past animosities , the rural masses in Punjab 's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled , working-class , urban culture . Hollywood films such as From This Day Forward ( 1946 ) , set in Highbridge , occasionally delved into Bronx life . Paddy Chayefsky 's Academy Award-winning Marty was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film The Catered Affair , and in the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri film , A Bronx Tale , Spike Lee 's 1999 movie Summer of Sam , centered in an Italian-American Bronx community , 1994 's I Like It Like That that takes place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx , and Doughboys , the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother 's gambling debts .
In December 1943 , President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . The following month , he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 . He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord , the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany .

In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data , Arno Tausch ( Corvinus University of Budapest ) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism . The Global Value Development Index , calculated by Tausch , relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law , no support for shadow economy , postmaterial activism , support for democracy , a non-acceptance of violence , xenophobia and racism , trust in transnational capital and Universities , confidence in the market economy , supporting gender justice , and engaging in environmental activism , etc .
YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005 . The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in September 2005 . Following a $ 3.5 million investment from Sequoia Capital in November , the site launched officially on December 15 , 2005 , by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day . The site grew rapidly , and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day , and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day . According to data published by market research company comScore , YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States , with a market share of around 43 % and more than 14 billion views of videos in May 2010 .
In the early stages of the First Punic War ( 264 BC ) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat . The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . Even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
Protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . In the nineteenth century , throughout the Anglo-American world , numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . As an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . To Bismarck this was " practical Christianity " . These programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the Western world .
Rome had no separate priestly caste or class . The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices , officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes . Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation . In household cult , the paterfamilias functioned as priest , and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants . Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise . The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines ( the singular is flamen ) , attributed to king Numa : the major flamines , dedicated to Jupiter , Mars and Quirinus , were traditionally drawn from patrician families . Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity , whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some . Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity ; Jupiter 's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career .
Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . A cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells . The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well . Two methods , the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease . The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria , both of which contain many significant human pathogens . The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia .
The Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056 . The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived ( Theotokos with raised hands , four evangelists with seraphim , scenes from Christ 's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos ) . In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures , detail , landscape and setting .
Punjab ( Urdu , Punjabi : پنجاب , panj-āb , " five waters " : listen ( help·info ) ) , also spelled Panjab , is the most populous of the four provinces of Pakistan . It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres ( 79,284 square miles ) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011 , approximately 56 % of the country 's total population . Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore . Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east . In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south , Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
President Truman , symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president , again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat . It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans . A " Draft Eisenhower " movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft . The effort was a long struggle ; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate , and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President . Henry Cabot Lodge , who served as his campaign manager , and others succeeded in convincing him , and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time . Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination , having won critical delegate votes from Texas . Eisenhower 's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan , " I Like Ike " . It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt 's policy at Yalta and against Truman 's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated . In defeating Taft for the nomination , it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party ; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose . Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike 's more advanced age .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
Dwight David " Ike " Eisenhower ( /ˈaɪzənˌhaʊ.ər/ EYE-zən-HOW-ər ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was an American politician and general who served as the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 . He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe . He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front . In 1951 , he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO .
The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa ( now Umm ar-Rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan . On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . Six mosaic masters signed the work : Staurachios from Esbus , Euremios , Elias , Constantinus , Germanus and Abdela . It overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " Church of Bishop Sergius . " Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .
In 1913 the Zliten mosaic , a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests , hunting and everyday life , was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten . In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna , Libya , uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD . The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer , four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground , and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue , staring at his slain opponent . The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa . The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a " masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii . "
The city of Kathmandu is named after Kasthamandap temple , that stood in Durbar Square . In Sanskrit , Kastha ( काष्ठ ) means " wood " and Mandap ( /मण्डप ) means " covered shelter " . This temple , also known as Maru Satal in the Newar language , was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla . The two-storey structure was made entirely of wood , and used no iron nails nor supports . According to legend , all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree . The structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages . The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
The Licchavis from the Indo-Gangetic plain migrated north and defeated the Kiratas , establishing the Licchavi dynasty . During this era , following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka , the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas . From Sankhu , they migrated to Yambu and Yengal ( Lanjagwal and Manjupattan ) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu . This created the basis of Newar Buddhism , which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world . With their migration , Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram during most of the Licchavi era .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
In 1999 , the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification , apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation , although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement . This is understandable , since there is no compelling authority within them . On 18 July 2006 , delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration .
Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . Practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . In 2003 , Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship , one of the categories of free flying . In August 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship .
In Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) , the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause . The court 's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable , " the court wrote . " Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a " wall , " is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "
Since June 2007 , YouTube 's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products . This required YouTube 's content to be transcoded into Apple 's preferred video standard , H.264 , a process that took several months . YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV , iPod Touch and the iPhone . In July 2010 , the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 , avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls . The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform . In September 2012 , YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone , following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system . According to GlobalWebIndex , YouTube was used by 35 % of smartphone users between April and June 2013 , making it the third most used app .
The ecumenical movement has had an influence on mainline churches , beginning at least in 1910 with the Edinburgh Missionary Conference . Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa , Asia and Oceania . Since 1948 , the World Council of Churches has been influential , but ineffective in creating a united church . There are also ecumenical bodies at regional , national and local levels across the globe ; but schisms still far outnumber unifications . One , but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement , has been the move to form united churches , such as the Church of South India , the Church of North India , the US-based United Church of Christ , the United Church of Canada , the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships . There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement , though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine .
On July 26 , 1931 , at a convention in Columbus , Ohio , Rutherford introduced the new name—Jehovah 's witnesses—based on Isaiah 43:10 : " Ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , and my servant whom I have chosen " —which was adopted by resolution . The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society , as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods . In 1932 , Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 , introduced what he called a " theocratic " ( literally , God-ruled ) organizational system , under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters .
At the end of May 1942 , Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold , commanding general of the Army Air Forces , to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England , Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney . He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment , stating he had an " uneasy feeling " about Chaney and his staff . On June 23 , 1942 , he returned to London as Commanding General , European Theater of Operations ( ETOUSA ) , based in London and with a house on Coombe , Kingston upon Thames , and replaced Chaney . He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7 .
In 1963 , the Robbins Report on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "
The Boudhanath , ( also written Bouddhanath , Bodhnath , Baudhanath or the Khāsa Chaitya ) , is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal , along with Swayambhu . It is a very popular tourist site . Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali . Located about 11 km ( 7 mi ) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu , the stupa 's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal . Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
Quakers , or Friends , are members of a family of religious movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends . The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers . Many Friends view themselves as members of a Christian denomination . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity . Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity , the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures .
Gephardt added that " inclusion and empowerment of the people on the line have to be done to get the best performance " from the minority party . Other techniques for fostering party harmony include the appointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with conflicting views to reach consensus on issues ; the creation of new leadership positions as a way to reach out and involve a greater diversity of partisans in the leadership structure ; and daily meetings in the Leader 's office ( or at breakfast , lunch , or dinner ) to lay out floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party .
The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society . In the middle Republican era , even Scipio 's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter 's special protege sat ill with his colleagues . Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal ; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus . Julius Caesar went further , and claimed her as his ancestress . Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired ; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation . In 63 BC , Julius Caesar 's appointment as pontifex maximus " signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics " . Likewise , political candidates could sponsor temples , priesthoods and the immensely popular , spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic . Under the principate , such opportunities were limited by law ; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ( " first citizen " ) .
Of the Christian minority in Egypt over 90 % belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church . Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church , the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations . Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria , such as the Syro-Lebanese , who belong to Greek Catholic , Greek Orthodox , and Maronite Catholic denominations .
On the domestic front , he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege . He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President , Richard Nixon . He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security . He also launched the Interstate Highway System , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act , and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act .
In the general election , against the advice of his advisors , Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South , refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party . The campaign strategy , dubbed " K1C2 " , was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues : Korea , Communism and corruption . In an effort to accommodate the right , he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only ; he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman .
Beginning in first decade of the 15th century , Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest , Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe 's writings , founded the Hussite movement . He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination . He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance , Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . After his execution , a revolt erupted . Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology . Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
The Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14 . Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern . Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta . The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96 . In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .
The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it , due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal . Indeed , Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons , while reducing conventional forces , and with them the overall defense budget , a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2 . This approach became known as the " New Look " , and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953 .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu , near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building . This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa . It is the most important museum in the country , housing an extensive collection of weapons , art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance . The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons , and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana , meaning " the stone house of arms and ammunition " . Given its focus , the museum contains many weapons , including locally made firearms used in wars , leather cannons from the 18th–19th century , and medieval and modern works in wood , bronze , stone and paintings .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
Democracy , social-contract theory , separation of powers , religious freedom , separation of church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers . Some of the philosophers of the English , Scottish , German , and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , John Toland , David Hume , Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , Christian Wolff , Immanuel Kant , and Jean-Jacques Rousseau - had Protestant backgrounds . For example , John Locke , whose political thought was based on " a set of Protestant Christian assumptions " , derived the equality of all humans , including the equality of the genders ( " Adam and Eve " ) , from Genesis 1 , 26-28 . As all persons were created equally free , all governments needed " the consent of the governed . " These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence , which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation : " We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . "
The word " police " was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century , but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces . The word , and the concept of police itself , were " disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression " ( according to Britannica 1911 ) . Before the 19th century , the first use of the word " police " recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798 .
Educational attainment : In 2000 , according to the U.S. Census , out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old , 62.3 % had graduated from high school and 14.6 % held a bachelor 's or higher college degree . These percentages were lower than those for New York 's other boroughs , which ranged from 68.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 82.6 % ( Staten Island ) for high school graduates over 24 , and from 21.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 49.4 % ( Manhattan ) for college graduates . ( The respective state and national percentages were [ NY ] 79.1 % & 27.4 % and [ US ] 80.4 % & 24.4 % . )
Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns ; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae , and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës , Albania in 1916 , is an early figural example ; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC . Mythological subjects , or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy , were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design , with strongly emphasized borders . Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name , describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl . Both of these themes were widely copied .
In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
Although the Reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . Since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most Protestant churches .
The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building , as the supercontinent Pangea came together . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana , which collided with North America-Europe ( Laurussia ) along the present line of eastern North America . This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe , and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America ; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains . In the same time frame , much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains . There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys . Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean ( closed by the assembly of South and North America ) , the small , shallow Ural Ocean ( which was closed by the collision of Baltica , and Siberia continents , creating the Ural Mountains ) and Proto-Tethys Ocean .
Jefferson 's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity , but this was a caricature . In setting up the University of Virginia , Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own , though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity , arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom . Some have argued that this arrangement was " fully compatible with Jefferson 's views on the separation of church and state ; " however , others point to Jefferson 's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation . Still other scholars , such as Mark David Hall , attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history
Robert N. Bellah has in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States . He used the term " Civil Religion " to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States . His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy : " Considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word 'God ' at all ? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . "

Small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside of Armenia for centuries . For example , a community has existed for over a millennium in the Holy Land , and one of the four quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem has been called the Armenian Quarter . An Armenian Catholic monastic community of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near Venice , Italy . There are also remnants of formerly populous communities in India , Myanmar , Thailand , Belgium , Portugal , Italy , Poland , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria , Romania , Serbia , Ethiopia , Sudan and Egypt .

Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
The 1981 film Fort Apache , The Bronx is another film that used the Bronx 's gritty image for its storyline . The movie 's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed " Fort Apache " . Also from 1981 is the horror film Wolfen making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures . Knights of the South Bronx , a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children , is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005 . The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film Fuga dal Bronx , also known as Bronx Warriors 2 and Escape 2000 , an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series Mystery Science Theatre 3000 . The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation 's plans to depopulate , destroy and redevelop the Bronx , and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation 's murderous ways and save their homes . The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase , " Leave the Bronx ! " Many of the movie 's scenes were filmed in Queens , substituting as the Bronx . Rumble in the Bronx was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film , another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences . Last Bronx , a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo , where crime and gang warfare is rampant .
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .
Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas , although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers , rather than the madrasa itself , granted the license or degree . Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Hossein Nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval Islamic madrasahs became universities . George Makdisi and others , however , argue that the European university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world . Other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics .
Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
There are several major exceptions on tuition fees . In many European countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . Public universities in Nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . Denmark , Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . Citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
In terms of ship categories , Greek companies have 22.6 % of the world 's tankers and 16.1 % of the world 's bulk carriers ( in dwt ) . An additional equivalent of 27.45 % of the world 's tanker dwt is on order , with another 12.7 % of bulk carriers also on order . Shipping accounts for an estimated 6 % of Greek GDP , employs about 160,000 people ( 4 % of the workforce ) , and represents 1/3 of the country 's trade deficit . Earnings from shipping amounted to €14.1 billion in 2011 , while between 2000 and 2010 Greek shipping contributed a total of €140 billion ( half of the country 's public debt in 2009 and 3.5 times the receipts from the European Union in the period 2000–2013 ) . The 2011 ECSA report showed that there are approximately 750 Greek shipping companies in operation .
Jefferson and Madison 's approach was not the only one taken in the eighteenth century . Jefferson 's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill , chiefly supported by Patrick Henry , which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination , but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it . Similarly , the Constitution of Massachusetts originally provided that " no subject shall be hurt , molested , or restrained , in his person , liberty , or estate , for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ... provided he doth not disturb the public peace , or obstruct others in their religious worship , " ( Article II ) but also that :
Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap . Mountain building in western North America continued , and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate , isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea . A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe . There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . During the Oligocene , South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America . It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow , rapidly cooling the continent .
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . Some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia , and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber . Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the Bona Dea rites .
Juscelino Kubitschek , President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961 , ordered the construction of Brasília , fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise . Building Brasília was part of Juscelino 's " fifty years of prosperity in five " plan . Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 , with 5550 people competing . Oscar Niemeyer , a close friend , was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer . Brasília was built in 41 months , from 1956 to April 21 , 1960 , when it was officially inaugurated .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Instruments like the duduk , the dhol , the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music . Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music . One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia . Many of these chants are ancient in origin , extending to pre-Christian times , while others are relatively modern , including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots , the inventor of the Armenian alphabet . Whilst under Soviet rule , Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music , for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane .
Although Egypt was a majority Christian country before the 7th Century , after Islam arrived , the country was slowly Islamified to become a majority Muslim country . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order .
Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body , grows and multiplies . This is referred to as colonization . Most humans are not easily infected . Those who are weak , sick , malnourished , have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections . Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections . Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface , generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity , nose , eyes , genitalia , anus , or the microbe can enter through open wounds . While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry , many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs . Some pathogens grow within the host cells ( intracellular ) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids .

Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery , located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds , hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors , and regularly organizes exhibitions . It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art . Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery , located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house , giving an important insight into Nepali history . The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu , near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg , Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent , established Nepali painters . The Nepal Art Council Gallery , located in the Babar Mahal , on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions .
Rome 's government , politics and religion were dominated by an educated , male , landowning military aristocracy . Approximately half Rome 's population were slave or free non-citizens . Most others were plebeians , the lowest class of Roman citizens . Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights ; far fewer could actually exercise them . Women had no vote . However , all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices , in the name of the senate and people of Rome . " In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine , just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans " .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
Between 1949 and the 1980s , telephone communications in Greece were a state monopoly by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization , better known by its acronym , OTE . Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s , OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe . Since 2011 , the company 's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40 % stake , while the Greek state continues to own 10 % of the company 's shares . OTE owns several subsidiaries across the Balkans , including Cosmote , Greece 's top mobile telecommunications provider , Cosmote Romania and Albanian Mobile Communications .
Energy production in Greece is dominated by the Public Power Corporation ( known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ , or in English DEI ) . In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6 % of all energy demand in Greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . Almost half ( 48 % ) of DEI 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009 . Another 12 % comes from Hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . Between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010 .
Institute of Medicine , the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is located in Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . It was established in 1972 and started to impart medical education from 1978 . A number of medical colleges including Kathmandu Medical College , Nepal Medical College , KIST Medical College , Nepal Army Institute of Health Sciences , National Academy of Medical Sciences ( NAMS ) and Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences ( KUSMS ) , are also located in or around Kathmandu .
In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament . The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections . In talks located in London that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower , when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections . In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria , and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S. , U.K. and France . At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called " Open Skies " to facilitate disarmament , which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other 's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely , particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany . They included nonconformists like the Puritans , who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England . Despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches . The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established Church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term , but as with other decisions , he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again . During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 , he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP 's potential candidates ; the group , in addition to his doctor , concluded a second term was well advised , and he announced in February 1956 he would run again . Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon 's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket ; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition . He personally favored Robert B. Anderson , a Democrat , who rejected his offer ; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party . In 1956 , Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide , with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6 % of the popular vote . The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations .
In 295 , a certain Maximilian refused military service ; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath . Both were executed for treason ; both were Christians . At some time around 302 , a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian 's domus and a subsequent ( but undated ) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity . The first ( 303 AD ) " ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts , forbade services to be held , degraded ofﬁcials who were Christians , re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians , and reduced the legal rights of all Christians ... [ Physical ] or capital punishments were not imposed on them " but soon after , several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed . The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice . An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods , in terms that recall the Decian edict .
In the Regal era , a rex sacrorum ( king of the sacred rites ) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king ( rex ) or in his absence , and announced the public festivals . He had little or no civil authority . With the abolition of monarchy , the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased . By the late Republican era , the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia . The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title : his religious duties still included the daily , ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus .
The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan . It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books . English , Nepali , Sanskrit , Hindi , and Nepal Bhasa books are found here . The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD . Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library , located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building . This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana . It covers a wide range of subjects including history , law , art , religion , and philosophy , as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra , which is believed to be over 1,000 years old . The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building , and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated .
The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute , in the form of the Heinrich Heine Memorial , better known as the Lorelei Fountain from one of Heine 's best-known works ( 1838 ) . After Heine 's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected , allegedly for anti-Semitic motives , a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet ( 1797–1856 ) , his incensed German-American admirers , including Carl Schurz , started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan , at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street . However , this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism , aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art .
Greece 's rail network is estimated to be at 2,548 km . Rail transport in Greece is operated by TrainOSE , a subsidiary of the Hellenic Railways Organization ( OSE ) . Most of the country 's network is standard gauge ( 1,565 km ) , while the country also has 983 km of narrow gauge . A total of 764 km of rail are electrified . Greece has rail connections with Bulgaria , the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey . A total of three suburban railway systems ( Proastiakos ) are in operation ( in Athens , Thessaloniki and Patras ) , while one metro system is operational in Athens with another under construction .
At about the same time , the word " humanism " as a philosophy centred on humankind ( as opposed to institutionalised religion ) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians , Arnold Ruge , and Karl Marx , who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government . There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms : philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history ; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists .
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . In 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns .
In Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) the court divided seizure into two parts , the investigatory stop and arrest . The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer 's search " [ is ] confined to what [ is ] minimally necessary to determine whether [ a suspect ] is armed , and the intrusion , which [ is ] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby , [ is ] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons " ( U.S. Supreme Court ) . Before Terry , every police encounter constituted an arrest , giving the police officer the full range of search authority . Search authority during a Terry stop ( investigatory stop ) is limited to weapons only .
In the wake of the Republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . Augustus , the first Roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . So-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire . Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . This was the context for Rome 's conflict with Christianity , which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
While the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . During the Punic crisis , popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy ; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with Roman Bacchus . Official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . Much later , a statue of Marsyas , the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus ' censorship . Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . Where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; Liber 's festival continued .
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint , Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation . Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . A variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : In fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names God knows . This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience .
The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( Tennessee Constitution Article IX , Section 2 is one such example . ) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me God . " In some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . At one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa ( now Umm ar-Rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan . On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . Six mosaic masters signed the work : Staurachios from Esbus , Euremios , Elias , Constantinus , Germanus and Abdela . It overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " Church of Bishop Sergius . " Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
Jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1879 ) the Court wrote that Jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ First ] Amendment . " In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , Justice Hugo Black wrote : " In the words of Thomas Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state . "
Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty-five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand-year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid-1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s .
Portuguese pavement ( in Portuguese , Calçada Portuguesa ) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal , and common throughout the Lusosphere . Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex , it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design . In Portuguese-speaking countries , many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even , though far more occasionally , streets done in this mosaic form . Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style .
The Bronx 's highest elevation at 280 feet ( 85 m ) is in the northwest corner , west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School . The opposite ( southeastern ) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or " necks " of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh : Hunt 's Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck and Throg 's Neck . Further up the coastline , Rodman 's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island . The Bronx 's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles ( 194 km2 ) .
Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays . Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal , which can be detected by some form of instrumentation . Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen . To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases , immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent . For example , immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle . Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism 's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus .
In the United States , August Vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . O.W . Wilson , a student of Vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita , Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . Strategies employed by O.W . Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . During the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
Maharaja Ranjit Singh 's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state . Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down , starting the First Anglo-Sikh War ; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to British India . After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 , the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India . In Jhelum 35 British soldiers of HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . [ citation needed ]
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening . The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it , and miraculously recovered , though he had to repeat his freshman year . He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college , though they lacked the funds . They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions .
On December 20 , 2005 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed , because the purpose of the display ( educating the public on American legal traditions ) was secular in nature . In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3 , 2006 , however , a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
All Protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the Church universal and generally deny the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . The various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the Bible alone ( rather than with Catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The " Five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of the day .
Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília . The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras ( " superblocks " ) : groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools , retail stores , and open spaces . At the northern end of Lake Paranoá , separated from the inner city , is a peninsula with many fashionable homes , and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore . Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake , but during early development private clubs , hotels , and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water . Set well apart from the city are satellite cities , including Gama , Ceilândia , Taguatinga , Núcleo Bandeirante , Sobradinho , and Planaltina . These cities , with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned .
The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively shaped the Church of Scotland . The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines , and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France . John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation . The Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope 's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560 , forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith . It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise , who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter .
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway , 12-696 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings , which are allowed , must allow various faiths to lead prayer , or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian . On May 5 , 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings , but also for sectarian prayers like predominately Christian prayers .
The mosaics of St. Peter 's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri , Guido Reni , Domenichino , Carlo Maratta , and many others . Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the Transfiguration . Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter 's , including Giovanni Battista Calandra , Fabio Cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and Pietro Paolo Cristofari ( died 1743 ) . Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
The phrase " [ A ] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world " was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams , the founder of the colony of Rhode Island , in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution . The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government , in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) :
Armenians constitute the main population of Armenia and the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic . There is a wide-ranging diaspora of around 5 million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside of modern Armenia . The largest Armenian populations today exist in Russia , the United States , France , Georgia , Iran , Ukraine , Lebanon , and Syria . With the exceptions of Iran and the former Soviet states , the present-day Armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the Armenian Genocide .
Larry Christenson , a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro , California , did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans . A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in Minneapolis . Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential ; especially " Hosanna ! " in Lakeville , and North Heights in St. Paul . The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the Alliance of Renewal Churches . There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach . Richard A. Jensen 's Touched by the Spirit published in 1974 , played a major role of the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement .
Official cults were state funded as a " matter of public interest " ( res publica ) . Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . The difference between public and private cult is often unclear . Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . Some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole . All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and pontifices .
Protestants reject the Roman Catholic Church 's doctrine that it is the one true church , believing in the invisible church , which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ . Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations , and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others . Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences . Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs . Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith , non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
Educational attainment : In 2000 , according to the U.S. Census , out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old , 62.3 % had graduated from high school and 14.6 % held a bachelor 's or higher college degree . These percentages were lower than those for New York 's other boroughs , which ranged from 68.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 82.6 % ( Staten Island ) for high school graduates over 24 , and from 21.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 49.4 % ( Manhattan ) for college graduates . ( The respective state and national percentages were [ NY ] 79.1 % & 27.4 % and [ US ] 80.4 % & 24.4 % . )
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
In contrast to the Proterozoic , Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments , such as graywackes , mudstones , volcanic sediments and banded iron formations . Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations , consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks . The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs , while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin . In short , greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents .
The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa ( now Umm ar-Rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan . On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . Six mosaic masters signed the work : Staurachios from Esbus , Euremios , Elias , Constantinus , Germanus and Abdela . It overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " Church of Bishop Sergius . " Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .

The Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the President of Brazil . The palace was designed , along with the rest of the city of Brasília , by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958 . One of the first structures built in the republic 's new capital city , the " Alvorada " lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Paranoá . The principles of simplicity and modernity , that in the past characterized the great works of architecture , motivated Niemeyer . The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box , softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns . The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement , landing , and second floor . The auditorium , kitchen , laundry , medical center , and administration offices are at basement level . The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing . The second floor has four suites , two apartments , and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace . The building also has a library , a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool , a music room , two dining rooms and various meeting rooms . A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
Historians trace the earliest church labeled Baptist back to 1609 in Amsterdam , with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the mid-18th century , the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South . The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership , as did the preachers ' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery , which had been part of the 18th-century teachings . Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent .
Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .
Football and Cricket are the most popular sports among the younger generation in Nepal and there are several stadiums in the city . The sport is governed by the All Nepal Football Association ( ANFA ) from its headquarters in Kathmandu . The only international football stadium in the city is the Dasarath Rangasala Stadium , a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for football matches and cultural events , located in the neighborhood of Tripureshwor . It is the largest stadium in Nepal with a capacity of 25,000 spectators , built in 1956 . Martyr 's Memorial League is also held in this ground every year . The stadium was renovated with Chinese help before the 8th South Asian Games were held in Kathmandu and had floodlights installed . Kathmandu is home to the oldest football clubs of Nepal such as RCT , Sankata and NRT . Other prominent clubs include MMC , Machhindra FC , Tribhuwan Army Club ( TAC ) and MPC .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map , made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba , Jordan . It was rediscovered in 1894 . The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land . It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south , and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert . The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem , at the center of the map . The map is enriched with many naturalistic features , like animals , fishing boats , bridges and palm trees
Energy production in Greece is dominated by the Public Power Corporation ( known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ , or in English DEI ) . In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6 % of all energy demand in Greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . Almost half ( 48 % ) of DEI 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009 . Another 12 % comes from Hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . Between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010 .
In the United States , August Vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . O.W . Wilson , a student of Vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita , Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . Strategies employed by O.W . Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . During the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
Kathmandu Metropolitan City ( KMC ) , in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat ( IRC ) . KMC 's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene , Oregon , United States . This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities : Motsumoto City of Japan , Rochester of the USA , Yangon ( formerly Rangoon ) of Myanmar , Xi'an of the People 's Republic of China , Minsk of Belarus , and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea . KMC 's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries , other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu .
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful . In the early days of Rome 's war against Carthage , the commander Publius Claudius Pulcher ( consul 249 BC ) launched a sea campaign " though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices . " In defiance of the omen , he threw them into the sea , " saying that they might drink , since they would not eat . He was defeated , and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator , he appointed his messenger Glycias , as if again making a jest of his country 's peril . " His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement . Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots , it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles . From there it spread around the world , carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there . These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history , such as seen in the two Great Awakenings . Pentecostalism , which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations , continues to be an important force in Western Christianity .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
From the 9th to 11th century , Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of Lake Van , this included both traditional styles and new innovations . Ornately carved Armenian Khachkars were developed during this time . Many new cities and churches were built during this time , including a new capital at Lake Van and a new Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match . The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty . It was during this time that the first major monasteries , such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were built . This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Augustus ' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals . They were given high-status seating at games and theatres . The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia , wife of Augustus . They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century , after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians . When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , he took steps toward the dissolution of the order . His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta 's sacred fire and vacated her temple .
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy . Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent . Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments , such as the compound light microscope , or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope . Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification . Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen . A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells . This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases , where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide , Protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the Anglican Communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former Prussian Union of churches ) . Nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity .
The spread of Greek literature , mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome 's festivals and rituals , and the embellishment of its mythology . Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus , who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals . In the last century of the Republic , Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite , most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods ; notably , Scaevola and the polymath Varro . For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus ' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction ; what the people believed was not itself the truth , but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with . Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives , the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals , and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .

Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Eisenhower , as well as the officers and troops under him , had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations , and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault . His first struggles , however , were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion ; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord . Admiral Ernest J . King fought with Eisenhower over King 's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific . He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord , to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented , as he did . Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter 's concern with civilian casualties ; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans , and Eisenhower prevailed . He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton , by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate , and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy .
In 1962 , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of officially-sponsored prayer or religious recitations in public schools . In Engel v. Vitale , 370 U.S. 421 ( 1962 ) , the Court , by a vote of 6-1 , determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools , even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation . ( The prayer required by the New York State Board of Regents prior to the Court 's decision consisted of : " Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee , and we beg Thy blessings upon us , our parents , our teachers , and our country . Amen . " ) As the Court stated :
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
During the later part of the Malla era , Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities : Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , and Kirtipur . These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal . These states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . Evidence of an influx of ideas from India , Tibet , China , Persia , and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla . Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g . Tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g . Haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g . Mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . Amarkosh , a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD , was also found . Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square , Patan Durbar Square , Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the former durbar of Kirtipur , Nyatapola , Kumbheshwar , the Krishna temple , and others .
House minority leaders also hold joint news conferences and consult with their counterparts in the Senate—and with the president if their party controls the White House . The overall objectives are to develop a coordinated communications strategy , to share ideas and information , and to present a united front on issues . Minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the House ; they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country ; and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements . They must also be prepared " to debate on the floor , ad lib , no notes , on a moment 's notice , " remarked Minority Leader Michel . In brief , minority leaders are key strategists in developing and promoting the party 's agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the opposition 's arguments and proposals .
The northwestern part of the South Asia , including Punjab , was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires , such as those of Tamerlane , Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan . Having conquered Drangiana , Arachosia , Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days , Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold , gems and pearls . However , Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains . Having taken a northeasterly direction , he marched against the Aspii ( mountaineers ) , who offered vigorous resistance , but were subdued . [ citation needed ] Alexander then marched through Ghazni , blockaded Magassa , and then marched to Ora and Bazira . Turning to the northeast , Alexander marched to Pucela , the capital of the district now known as Pakhli . He entered Western Punjab , where the ancient city of Nysa ( at the site of modern-day Mong ) was situated . A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians , the people of Multan , who were very skilful in war . Alexander invested many troops , eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle , and the city of Sagala ( present-day Sialkot ) was razed to the ground . Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C . and took his army to the heartlands of his empire . [ citation needed ]
Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
Organizations including Viacom , Mediaset , and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube , claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material . Viacom , demanding $ 1 billion in damages , said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " . YouTube responded by stating that it " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha . It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches , each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra , om mani padme hum . At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima , the goddess of smallpox . Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure , walk around the stupa with prayer wheels , chant , and pray . Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex . The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas ( monasteries ) around Boudhanath .
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods : a boom period during 1900–29 , with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930 . The Great Depression and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline . The mid to late century were hard times , as the Bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty . The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today .
In the wake of religious riots in Egypt , the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to " ancestral gods " or suffer a penalty : only Jews were exempt . Decius ' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults ; no ancestral gods were specified by name . The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman . Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective ; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults , but apostasy was sought , rather than capital punishment . A year after its due deadline , the edict expired .

However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
In China , Yellow Emperor is regarded as the humanistic primogenitor . [ citation needed ] Sage kings such as Yao and Shun are humanistic figures as recorded . [ citation needed ] King Wu of Zhou has the famous saying : " Humanity is the Ling ( efficacious essence ) of the world ( among all ) . " Among them Duke of Zhou , respected as a founder of Rujia ( Confucianism ) , is especially prominent and pioneering in humanistic thought . His words were recorded in the Book of History as follows ( translation ) : [ citation needed ]
Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada . Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization , more than 4000 years ago . The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa . The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation . The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River . This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan . Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found . Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas , Achaemenids , Macedonians , Mauryas , Kushans , Guptas , and Hindu Shahi . It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time , otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire . Agriculture flourished and trading cities ( such as Multan and Lahore ) grew in wealth .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
Among the vast varieties of microorganisms , relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals . Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect . The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen , depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen . However a host 's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection . Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens :
Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co-ordinate their work , share information , and get help quickly . In recent years , vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatching of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and updating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real-time basis . Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches , whistles , police notebooks and " ticket books " or citations .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers , and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system . Their job was apolitical ; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law . This was very different to the 'Continental model ' of the police force that had been developed in France , where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state .
Much of YouTube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . In 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . In May 2013 , Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . In February 2015 , Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's " Rational Clinical Examination Series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11-20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64-0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64-0.88 ) .
The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it , due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal . Indeed , Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons , while reducing conventional forces , and with them the overall defense budget , a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2 . This approach became known as the " New Look " , and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953 .
Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
In 1899 , the memorial , by the Berlin sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter ( 1846–1917 ) , finally came to rest , although subject to repeated vandalism , in the Bronx , at 164th Street and the Grand Concourse , or Joyce Kilmer Park near today 's Yankee Stadium . ( In 1999 , it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse . ) In 2007 , Christopher Gray of The New York Times described it as " a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei , the mythical German figure , surrounded by mermaids , dolphins and seashells . "
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
Haruspicy was also used in public cult , under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate . The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice , particularly the liver . They also interpreted omens , prodigies and portents , and formulated their expiation . Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient , ethnically Etruscan " outsider " religious profession , separate from Rome 's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy , essential but never quite respectable . During the mid-to-late Republic , the reformist Gaius Gracchus , the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla , and the " notorious Verres " justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners . The senate and armies used the public haruspices : at some time during the late Republic , the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination . Being of independent means , they would be better motivated to maintain a pure , religious practice for the public good . The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect : none of this seems to have troubled Marius , who employed a Syrian prophetess .
In the high Renaissance , in fact , there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity , including the writings of the Church fathers , the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels , and in some cases even the Jewish Kabbalah , would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement . With this end in view , Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought . One humanist , the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho ( 1355–1452 ) , based in Mystras , Greece ( but in contact with humanists in Florence , Venice , and Rome ) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology . Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid-1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9.7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5 % per year .
The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement . Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles , gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way ( via media ) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions . The English Reformation followed a particular course . The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII . King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome . In 1534 , the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . Between 1535 and 1540 , under Thomas Cromwell , the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect . Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I , a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I . The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition . The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other . It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century .
Jefferson and Madison 's approach was not the only one taken in the eighteenth century . Jefferson 's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill , chiefly supported by Patrick Henry , which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination , but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it . Similarly , the Constitution of Massachusetts originally provided that " no subject shall be hurt , molested , or restrained , in his person , liberty , or estate , for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ... provided he doth not disturb the public peace , or obstruct others in their religious worship , " ( Article II ) but also that :
In the United States , August Vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . O.W . Wilson , a student of Vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita , Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . Strategies employed by O.W . Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . During the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion . Most important was " the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life , " which sought to confine religion to a private sphere . Further , the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants ( and most Jews ) , who opposed aid to religious schools , which were mostly Catholic at the time . After 1980 , however , anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants , and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed . While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state , much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position . As a consequence , strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths , even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics . [ citation needed ]
On May 1 , 1960 , a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over Soviet Union airspace . The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an East–West summit conference , which had been scheduled in Paris , 15 days later . Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil . Four days after Powers disappeared , the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had " gone missing " north of Turkey . It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged , and falsely claimed that " the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties . "
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
Edgar took the first turn at school , and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery . Edgar asked for a second year , Dwight consented and worked for a second year . At that time , a friend " Swede " Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school , since no tuition was required . Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S . Senator , Joseph L. Bristow . Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition , he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy . He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911 .
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
The Abbot of Monte Cassino , Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church . According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse , the arch and the vestibule of the basilica . Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds ( now in the Monte Cassino Museum ) . " The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts " – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy .
Punjab is Pakistan 's second largest province in terms of land area at 205,344 km2 ( 79,284 sq mi ) , after Balochistan , and is located at the north western edge of the geologic Indian plate in South Asia . The province is bordered by Kashmir ( Azad Kashmir , Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir , India ) to the northeast , the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east , the Pakistani province of Sindh to the south , the province of Balochistan to the southwest , the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the north .
Subsequent to this decision , the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause , known as the " Lemon Test " . First , the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose . Second , the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . Third , the statute or policy must not result in an " excessive entanglement " of government with religion . ( The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools , and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church 's religious mission , thus the policy involved the state in an " excessive entanglement " with religion . ) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause .
In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation , Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion . These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom . In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Latvia , Estonia and Hungary , it remains one of the most popular religions . Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements , there are only few Protestant adherents ; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs , restrictions during the Communist rule , and also the ongoing secularization . Over the last several decades , religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased . According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer , Protestants made up 12 % of the EU population . According to Pew Research Center , Protestants constituted nearly one fifth ( or 17.8 % ) of the continent 's Christian population in 2010 . Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15 % of all Europeans in 2009 , while Noll claims that less than 12 % of them lived in Europe in 2010 .
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu , near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building . This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa . It is the most important museum in the country , housing an extensive collection of weapons , art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance . The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons , and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana , meaning " the stone house of arms and ammunition " . Given its focus , the museum contains many weapons , including locally made firearms used in wars , leather cannons from the 18th–19th century , and medieval and modern works in wood , bronze , stone and paintings .
The centrality of the " separation " concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that " The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . "
The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639 . The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various European countries ( particularly Ireland , Germany and Italy ) and later from the Caribbean region ( particularly Puerto Rico , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic ) , as well as African American migrants from the American South . This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop .
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover .
Armenians constitute the main population of Armenia and the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic . There is a wide-ranging diaspora of around 5 million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside of modern Armenia . The largest Armenian populations today exist in Russia , the United States , France , Georgia , Iran , Ukraine , Lebanon , and Syria . With the exceptions of Iran and the former Soviet states , the present-day Armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the Armenian Genocide .
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . The size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier . Traditionally , these festivals were celebrated by Newars . In recent years , these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well . As the capital of the Republic of Nepal , various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu . With mass migration to the city , the cultures of Khas from the west , Kirats from the east , Bon/Tibetan from the north , and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously . The festivities such as the Ghode ( horse ) Jatra , Indra Jatra , Dashain Durga Puja festivals , Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm . Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics . These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings , as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion .
In Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) the court divided seizure into two parts , the investigatory stop and arrest . The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer 's search " [ is ] confined to what [ is ] minimally necessary to determine whether [ a suspect ] is armed , and the intrusion , which [ is ] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby , [ is ] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons " ( U.S. Supreme Court ) . Before Terry , every police encounter constituted an arrest , giving the police officer the full range of search authority . Search authority during a Terry stop ( investigatory stop ) is limited to weapons only .

The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople . Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels , the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia . They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites . The esonarthex has two fluted domes , specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ . The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos . The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban , offering the model of the church to Christ . The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ . These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings , landscapes , figures .
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science . In fact , more than 80 % of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained , of which approximately 45 % held university posts . It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable , and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development . There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system , which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world . However , university professors still utilized some autonomy , at least in the sciences , to choose epistemological foundations and methods . For instance , Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction . Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .
In June 2007 , YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom , which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . The system , which became known as Content ID , creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . When a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
As of 2010 , 46.29 % ( 584,463 ) of Bronx residents aged five and older spoke Spanish at home , while 44.02 % ( 555,767 ) spoke English , 2.48 % ( 31,361 ) African languages , 0.91 % ( 11,455 ) French , 0.90 % ( 11,355 ) Italian , 0.87 % ( 10,946 ) various Indic languages , 0.70 % ( 8,836 ) other Indo-European languages , and Chinese was spoken at home by 0.50 % ( 6,610 ) of the population over the age of five . In total , 55.98 % ( 706,783 ) of the Bronx 's population age five and older spoke a language at home other than English . A Garifuna-speaking community from Honduras and Guatemala also makes the Bronx its home .
In Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 ( 1968 ) , the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime " to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals , " or " to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches " this theory in any school or university that received public funds . The court 's opinion , written by Justice Abe Fortas , ruled that the Arkansas law violated " the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . The overriding fact is that Arkansas ' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine ; that is , with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group . " The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion , and that " [ T ] he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them . "
Traditionally , the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the House , with the Majority Leader as second-in-command . For instance , when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections , Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader . Despite this , Cantor and his successor , Kevin McCarthy , have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House , since Boehner is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans . However , there have been some exceptions . The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006 . In contrast , the Minority Leader is the undisputed leader of the minority party .
In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede , Santa Maria in Domnica , Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura , Santa Cecilia in Trastevere , Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano . The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics . They were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . Another great work of Pope Leo , the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna , depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side , and SS . Susanna and Felicity on the other . It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . Pope Paschal I ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
In the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one party , the Speaker normally assumes a lower profile and defers to the President . For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a de facto " leader of the opposition " , often more so than the Senate Minority Leader , due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership . Minority Leaders who have played prominent roles in opposing the incumbent President have included Gerald Ford , Richard Gephardt , Nancy Pelosi , and John Boehner .
Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill , George S. Patton , George Marshall , and General Montgomery during World War II . Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur , and that a positive relationship endured . While in Manila , Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully . Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 . He also learned to fly , making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot 's license in 1939 at Fort Lewis . Also around this time , he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government , namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur , to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned , now named Quezon City , but he declined the offer .
The Portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum . The city has six international schools : American School of Brasília , Brasília International School ( BIS ) , Escola das Nações , Swiss International School ( SIS ) , Lycée français François-Mitterrand ( LfFM ) and Maple Bear Canadian School . August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - The British School of Brasilia . Brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine 's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt . Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine 's Monastery is exceptional . On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background . In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background . The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets , and two contemporary figure , " Abbot Longinos " and " John the Deacon " . The mosaic was probably created in 565/6 .
That evening , Eisenhower 's body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene , Kansas , the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an American president . His body arrived on April 2 , and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library . The president 's body was buried as a General of the Army . The family used an $ 80 standard soldier 's casket , and dressed Eisenhower 's body in his famous short green jacket . His only medals worn were : the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , and the Legion of Merit . Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud , who died at age 3 in 1921 . His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979 .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
The centrality of the " separation " concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that " The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . "
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
Most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . However , it was the retroactive application of ESA95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by Eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of GDP , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . This led to claims that Greece ( similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .
Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots . Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva . He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there . Despite heavy persecution , the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment . French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character , made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s . This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts , known as the French Wars of Religion . The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559 . Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time , illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of August 1572 , when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France . The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes , promising official toleration of the Protestant minority , but under highly restricted conditions . Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion , and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century , culminating in Louis XIV 's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again . In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau , Frederick William I , Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam , giving free passage to Huguenot refugees . In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England , the Netherlands , Prussia , Switzerland , and the English and Dutch overseas colonies . A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region .
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
On the morning of March 28 , 1969 , at the age of 78 , Eisenhower died in Washington , D.C. of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The following day his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral 's Bethlehem Chapel , where he lay in repose for 28 hours . On March 30 , his body was brought by caisson to the United States Capitol , where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda . On March 31 , Eisenhower 's body was returned to the National Cathedral , where he was given an Episcopal Church funeral service .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
Prior to his inauguration , Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the Korean War to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy . His inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations .
Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of " separation of church and state " , or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment . Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution , while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified . These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers . Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts , and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence , which references the idea of a " Creator " and " Nature 's God " , though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a " Creator " or " Nature 's God . "
Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide , Protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the Anglican Communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former Prussian Union of churches ) . Nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .

Kathmandu ( /ˌkɑːtmɑːnˈduː/ ; Nepali pronunciation : [ kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu ] ) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal . It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar ( Metropolitan City ) , as compared to Upa-Mahanagar ( Sub-Metropolitan City ) or Nagar ( City ) . Kathmandu is the core of Nepal 's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi , Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities . Kathmandu is also known informally as " KTM " or the " tri-city " . According to the 2011 census , Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures 49.45 km2 ( 19.09 sq mi ) .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal . Of these , Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres ( 3,900–7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres ( 6,900–10,800 ft ) . Under Köppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( Cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . In the Kathmandu Valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C ( 82–86 °F ) . The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C ( 50.2 °F ) .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common , their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness , whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment , the nature of immortality , whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium , and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth . The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible , leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath . The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church 's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs ( 1980 and 2005 ) , which use Biblical references as justification .

In 295 , a certain Maximilian refused military service ; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath . Both were executed for treason ; both were Christians . At some time around 302 , a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian 's domus and a subsequent ( but undated ) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity . The first ( 303 AD ) " ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts , forbade services to be held , degraded ofﬁcials who were Christians , re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians , and reduced the legal rights of all Christians ... [ Physical ] or capital punishments were not imposed on them " but soon after , several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed . The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice . An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods , in terms that recall the Decian edict .
Legendary Princess Bhrikuti ( 7th-century ) and artist Araniko ( 1245 - 1306 AD ) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China . There are over 108 traditional monasteries ( Bahals and Bahis ) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism . Since the 1960s , the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area . Also , with the modernization of Newar Buddhism , various Theravada Bihars have been established .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .

The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85 . The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . They were laid down in the Umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
Among the vast varieties of microorganisms , relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals . Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect . The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen , depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen . However a host 's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection . Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens :
The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
After fourteen consecutive years of economic growth , Greece went into recession in 2008 . By the end of 2009 , the Greek economy faced the highest budget deficit and government debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU . After several upward revisions , the 2009 budget deficit is now estimated at 15.7 % of GDP . This , combined with rapidly rising debt levels ( 127.9 % of GDP in 2009 ) led to a precipitous increase in borrowing costs , effectively shutting Greece out of the global financial markets and resulting in a severe economic crisis .
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas , allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses . Mosaic murals , benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smoother and more even surface .
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities , resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices . In one decade , the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001 . The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021 . To keep up this population growth , the KMC-controlled area of 5,076.6 hectares ( 12,545 acres ) has expanded to 8,214 hectares ( 20,300 acres ) in 2001 . With this new area , the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001 ; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021 .
The apse mosaic of the Gelati Monastery is a rare example of mosaic use in Georgia . Began by king David IV and completed by his son Demetrius I of Georgia , the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels . The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids . The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople . Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other , lesser known sites . The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes . In Tsromi the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme . Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
The ecumenical movement has had an influence on mainline churches , beginning at least in 1910 with the Edinburgh Missionary Conference . Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa , Asia and Oceania . Since 1948 , the World Council of Churches has been influential , but ineffective in creating a united church . There are also ecumenical bodies at regional , national and local levels across the globe ; but schisms still far outnumber unifications . One , but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement , has been the move to form united churches , such as the Church of South India , the Church of North India , the US-based United Church of Christ , the United Church of Canada , the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships . There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement , though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine .
During the Eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago ) , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . At the beginning of the period , Australia and Antarctica remained connected , and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters , distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high . But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma , the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica , and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents . The Antarctic region cooled down , and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze , sending cold water and ice floes north , reinforcing the cooling . The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago . [ citation needed ]
Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is : in whose interest is it ? At a more practical level , the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable ( Sheptycki , 2004 ) . For example , according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 ( Lloyd , et al . 2007 ) Interpol had the lowest scores in its category ( IGOs ) , coming in tenth with a score of 22 % on overall accountability capabilities ( p. 19 ) . As this report points out , and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm , this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends . According to Swayambhu Purana , present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake names " Nagdaha " as it was full of snakes . The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa Manjusri with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land . After sometimes , a demon named Banasur closed the outlet and the valley was again a lake . Then lots Krishna came to Nepal , killed Banasur and again drained out water . He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences . Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . Concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . While YouTube 's revenue-sharing " Partner Program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels " . In 2013 Forbes ' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media . In 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega " , " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo . By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts .
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
Portuguese pavement ( in Portuguese , Calçada Portuguesa ) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal , and common throughout the Lusosphere . Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex , it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design . In Portuguese-speaking countries , many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even , though far more occasionally , streets done in this mosaic form . Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style .
The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively shaped the Church of Scotland . The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines , and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France . John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation . The Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope 's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560 , forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith . It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise , who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter .
The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson ( later U.S. president ) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House , both from Texas . Joe Martin , the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that Eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . There were exceptions , Leonard W. Hall , for example , who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . However , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
On the other hand , in his study on nine of " the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world " , Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn , Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University , wrote : “The NW [ New World Translation ] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators , BeDuhn stated : “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal , conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament " violate [ s ] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God " .
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy . Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent . Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments , such as the compound light microscope , or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope . Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification . Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen . A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells . This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases , where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly .
During this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( Federalists and Democratic-Republicans ) had an official leader . In 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " In 1828 , a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on Capitol Hill :
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( Amendment XIV ) is one of the post-Civil War amendments , intended to secure rights for former slaves . It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others . The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states . While it has not been fully implemented , the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure , through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause , the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states .
The agglomeration of Kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . The urban area of the Kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . They have the three highest population densities in the country . Within the districts lie VDCs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( Bhaktapur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( Lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( Kathmandu ) . Some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , Gonggabu VDC notably recorded a density over 20,000 people/km2 . ( 2011 census ) . The following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
Despite the lack of a coastline , Punjab is the most industrialised province of Pakistan ; its manufacturing industries produce textiles , sports goods , heavy machinery , electrical appliances , surgical instruments , vehicles , auto parts , metals , sugar mill plants , aircraft , cement , agricultural machinery , bicycles and rickshaws , floor coverings , and processed foods . In 2003 , the province manufactured 90 % of the paper and paper boards , 71 % of the fertilizers , 69 % of the sugar and 40 % of the cement of Pakistan .
According to a story that has often been repeated in the media , Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005 , after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen 's apartment in San Francisco . Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred , but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party " was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible " .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
Soteriologically , most Methodists are Arminian , emphasizing that Christ accomplished salvation for every human being , and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it ( as opposed to the traditional Calvinist doctrine of monergism ) . Methodism is traditionally low church in liturgy , although this varies greatly between individual congregations ; the Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition ; John Wesley 's brother , Charles , was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church , and many other eminent hymn writers come from the Methodist tradition .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available . The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable . The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) . These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins . A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it , due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal . Indeed , Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons , while reducing conventional forces , and with them the overall defense budget , a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2 . This approach became known as the " New Look " , and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953 .
Divorce is discouraged , and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery , which they refer to as " a scriptural divorce " . If a divorce is obtained for any other reason , remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality . Extreme physical abuse , willful non-support of one 's family , and what the religion terms " absolute endangerment of spirituality " are considered grounds for legal separation .
In the following century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art ( see details in Ravenna section ) . Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century . In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo , mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah ; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors , naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion . The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio , which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century , although it was restored many times later . The baptistery of the basilica , which was demolished in the 15th century , had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae , large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated . In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro , now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio , every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century . Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome , while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background . The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists .
YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005 . The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in September 2005 . Following a $ 3.5 million investment from Sequoia Capital in November , the site launched officially on December 15 , 2005 , by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day . The site grew rapidly , and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day , and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day . According to data published by market research company comScore , YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States , with a market share of around 43 % and more than 14 billion views of videos in May 2010 .
The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties , including the power of reason . That means that they are allowed to explore God 's creation and , according to Genesis 2:15 , make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way . Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences . Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers , in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ , are to follow God 's commandments . Industry , frugality , calling , discipline , and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code . In particular , Calvin rejected luxury . Therefore , craftsmen , industrialists , and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology . As a result , productivity grew , which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages . In this way , the economy , the sciences , and technology reinforced each other . The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors . The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution . This idea is also known as the " Protestant ethic thesis . "
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings , a far more prestigious artform , and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos . Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek , suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire ; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves . Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa , in places such as Carthage , and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis , Tunisia .
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
While the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . During the Punic crisis , popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy ; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with Roman Bacchus . Official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . Much later , a statue of Marsyas , the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus ' censorship . Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . Where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; Liber 's festival continued .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Counting shipping as quasi-exports and in terms of monetary value , Greece ranked 4th globally in 2011 having " exported " shipping services worth 17,704.132 million $ ; only Denmark , Germany and South Korea ranked higher during that year . Similarly counting shipping services provided to Greece by other countries as quasi-imports and the difference between " exports " and " imports " as a " trade balance " , Greece in 2011 ranked in the latter second behind Germany , having " imported " shipping services worth 7,076.605 million US $ and having run a " trade surplus " of 10,712.342 million US $ .
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean . In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean , the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the Proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . Roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , 600–540 Ma .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
Eisenhower 's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations , a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan , and The American Assembly , Eisenhower 's " vision of a great cultural center where business , professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature " . His biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as " the political education of General Eisenhower " , since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational , administrative , and financial demands for the university . Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations , he also gained exposure to economic analysis , which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy . " Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics , he has learned at the study group meetings , " one Aid to Europe member claimed .
In May 1955 , McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel . Eisenhower was furious , and issued an order as follows : " It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters ... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications , or any documents or reproductions , concerning such advice be disclosed . " This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting , and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege . Ike 's denial of McCarthy 's access to his staff reduced McCarthy 's hearings to rants about trivial matters , and contributed to his ultimate downfall .
During the late 1920s and early 1930s , Eisenhower 's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat , as military priorities diminished ; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs . He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing , and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower , then a journalist at the Agriculture Department , he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe . He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928 . After a one-year assignment in France , Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely , Assistant Secretary of War , from 1929 to February 1933 . Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Industrial College ( Washington , DC ) in 1933 and later served on the faculty ( it was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy ) .
Within the diasporan Armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of Armenians . For example , Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as Parskahay ( Պարսկահայ ) , while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as Lipananahay ( Լիբանանահայ ) . Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language . This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine , Russia , and Georgia ( where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province ) . In diverse communities ( such as in Canada and the U.S. ) where many different kinds of Armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
Sociologist Rodney Stark states that Jehovah 's Witness leaders are " not always very democratic " and that members " are expected to conform to rather strict standards , " but adds that " enforcement tends to be very informal , sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group " , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as " part of the power structure rather than subject to it . " Sociologist Andrew Holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah 's Witnesses have made an informed choice . However , he also states that defectors " are seldom allowed a dignified exit " , and describes the administration as autocratic .
All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration . Users who have a good track record of complying with the site 's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length , which requires verifying the account , normally through a mobile phone . When YouTube was launched in 2005 , it was possible to upload long videos , but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films . The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010 . If an up-to-date browser version is used , videos greater than 20 GB can be uploaded .
Just as artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci – partaking of the zeitgeist though not himself a humanist – advocated study of human anatomy , nature , and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art , so Spanish-born humanist Juan Luis Vives ( c. 1493–1540 ) advocated observation , craft , and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities , helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism . Thus , the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to natural philosophy , based on empirical observations and experimentation of the physical universe , making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance .
Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is : in whose interest is it ? At a more practical level , the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable ( Sheptycki , 2004 ) . For example , according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 ( Lloyd , et al . 2007 ) Interpol had the lowest scores in its category ( IGOs ) , coming in tenth with a score of 22 % on overall accountability capabilities ( p. 19 ) . As this report points out , and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm , this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement .
According to a story that has often been repeated in the media , Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005 , after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen 's apartment in San Francisco . Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred , but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party " was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible " .
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint , Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation . Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . A variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : In fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names God knows . This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience .
Since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the Bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " Ten-Year Housing Plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units . The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos ' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx . The IRT White Plains Road Line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . Chains such as Marshalls , Staples , and Target opened stores in the Bronx . More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
In July 1953 , an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 . The armistice and boundary remain in effect today , with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it . The armistice , concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles , South Korean President Syngman Rhee , and also within Eisenhower 's party , has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration . Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable , and limited war unwinnable .
The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers , and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system . Their job was apolitical ; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law . This was very different to the 'Continental model ' of the police force that had been developed in France , where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state .
A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize . However , as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church , all other sacraments ( except marriage ) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid . Therefore , Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized ( although they are confirmed ) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study .
Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery , exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university , and the ideas of those texts into society generally , their influence was ultimately quite progressive . The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate ( as the notable list of scholars above attests to ) . A focus on knowledge coming from self , from the human , has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction , and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities . This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts , but also their adaptation and expansion . For instance , Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen , but he also invigorated this text with experimentation , disagreements and further research . The propagation of these texts , especially within the universities , was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular , which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices .
A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous ; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian . There was also a drop in south polar temperatures ; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period , though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not . These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics , where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers . A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction , one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard . This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period .
The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta , goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame . A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction , public status and privileges , and could exercise considerable political influence . Upon entering her office , a Vestal was emancipated from her father 's authority . In archaic Roman society , these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man , instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus .
The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) .
Since the 19th century , many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or " gatekeeper " , sometimes described as the President 's Private Secretary , sometimes with no official title at all . Eisenhower formalized this role , introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army . Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position . Initially , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff , but each eventually appointed one .
The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower , Nikita Khrushchev , Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident . Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev 's demands that he apologize . Therefore , Khrushchev would not take part in the summit . Up until this event , Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union . Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit . Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that " stupid U-2 business " .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
Colloquially , the term university may be used to describe a phase in one 's life : " When I was at university ... " ( in the United States and Ireland , college is often used instead : " When I was in college ... " ) . In Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Nigeria , the Netherlands , Spain and the German-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni . In Ghana , New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called " varsity " ( although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years ) . " Varsity " was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] " Varsity " is still in common usage in Scotland .
The Bronx Museum of the Arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx . Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from Africa , Asia and Latin America , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica .
Protestants reject the Roman Catholic Church 's doctrine that it is the one true church , believing in the invisible church , which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ . Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations , and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others . Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences . Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs . Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith , non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant .
Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925 , and continued through the Democrats ' control of the House from 1931 to 1995 , save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55 , all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent . The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965 , Hale Boggs who died in a plane crash , and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats ' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections . Since 1995 , the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner , though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections . He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011 . In 1998 , with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation , both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert .
Kathmandu is home to Nepali cinema and theaters . The city contains several theaters , including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path , the Ganga Theatre , the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982 . The M. Art Theater is based in the city . The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival , attracting artists from all over the world . A mini theater is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square , established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
In recent years a number of well-known tourism-related organizations have placed Greek destinations in the top of their lists . In 2009 Lonely Planet ranked Thessaloniki , the country 's second-largest city , the world 's fifth best " Ultimate Party Town " , alongside cities such as Montreal and Dubai , while in 2011 the island of Santorini was voted as the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure . The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe . Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014 .
Islamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire . In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art . During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world , although tile was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide , [ ad ] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians . [ ae ] In 2010 , a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa , 260 million in the Americas , 140 million in Asia-Pacific region , 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa . Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population . Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world 's Christians at 33 % , 36 % , 36.7 % , and 40 % , while in relation to the world 's population at 11.6 % and 13 % .
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions , which they consider a violation of God 's law based on their interpretation of Acts 15:28 , 29 and other scriptures . Since 1961 the willing acceptance of a blood transfusion by an unrepentant member has been grounds for expulsion from the religion . Members are directed to refuse blood transfusions , even in " a life-or-death situation " . Jehovah 's Witnesses accept non-blood alternatives and other medical procedures in lieu of blood transfusions , and their literature provides information about non-blood medical procedures .
Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the drachma . After signing the Maastricht Treaty , Greece applied to join the eurozone . The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of GDP . Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . On 1 January 2001 , Greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . However , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002 . This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 March 2012 .
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 . In November 2008 , YouTube reached an agreement with MGM , Lions Gate Entertainment , and CBS , allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site , accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called " Shows " . The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu , which features material from NBC , Fox , and Disney . In November 2009 , YouTube launched a version of " Shows " available to UK viewers , offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners . In January 2010 , YouTube introduced an online film rentals service , which is available only to users in the US , Canada and the UK as of 2010 . The service offers over 6,000 films .
In 1957 , the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision . Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order . When Faubus balked , the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division . They escorted and protected nine black students ' entry to Little Rock Central High School , an all-white public school , for the first time since the Reconstruction Era . Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions , writing " The overwhelming majority of southerners , Negro and white , stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock " .
While the decision ( with four dissents ) ultimately upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools , the majority opinion ( by Justice Hugo Black ) and the dissenting opinions ( by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge and Justice Robert H. Jackson ) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a " wall between church and state " or a " separation of Church from State " : their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall . Rutledge , on behalf of the four dissenting justices , took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case : " Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia 's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment , now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth . " Writing separately , Justice Jackson argued that " [ T ] here are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation . In fact , the undertones of the opinion , advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State , seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters . "
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip , who is the chief vote counter for his or her party . The current chief deputy majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry . Within the House Republican Conference , the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House Leadership . The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy whips , led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip , which is the highest appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus . The current senior chief deputy minority whip , John Lewis , has held his post since 1991 .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
In January 2010 , YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard . This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed . The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial . Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the H.264 or WebM formats could play the videos , and not all videos on the site were available .

Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings , individually and collectively , and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence ( rationalism , empiricism ) over acceptance of dogma or superstition . The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it . Generally , however , humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress . In modern times , humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism , and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world .

There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
The terms international policing , transnational policing , and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) , ( Sheptycki , 1995 ) . These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that , in some sense , transcend national borders . This includes a variety of practices , but international police cooperation , criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation-states , and police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention .
The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia . The city is located in an ancient lake basin , with fertile soil and flat terrain . This geography helped form a society based on agriculture . This , combined with its location between India and China , helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries . Kathmandu 's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet . From centuries past , Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia . Other traditional occupations are farming , metal casting , woodcarving , painting , weaving , and pottery .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
The great Navicella mosaic ( 1305–1313 ) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter 's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone . The giant mosaic , commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi , was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard . It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters . This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter 's in the 17th century . Navicella means " little ship " referring to the large boat which dominated the scene , and whose sail , filled by the storm , loomed over the horizon . Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art .
On the domestic front , he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege . He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President , Richard Nixon . He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security . He also launched the Interstate Highway System , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act , and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act .
In Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) the court divided seizure into two parts , the investigatory stop and arrest . The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer 's search " [ is ] confined to what [ is ] minimally necessary to determine whether [ a suspect ] is armed , and the intrusion , which [ is ] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby , [ is ] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons " ( U.S. Supreme Court ) . Before Terry , every police encounter constituted an arrest , giving the police officer the full range of search authority . Search authority during a Terry stop ( investigatory stop ) is limited to weapons only .
Protestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation , today regarded as branches . Some of these movements have a common lineage , sometimes directly spawning individual denominations . Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations , this section discusses only the largest denominational families , or branches , widely considered to be a part of Protestantism . These are , in alphabetical order : Adventist , Anglican , Baptist , Calvinist ( Reformed ) , Lutheran , Methodist and Pentecostal . A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed .
The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century , stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort : " The law of love , peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews , Turks and Egyptians , as they are considered sons of Adam , which is the glory of the outward state of Holland , so love , peace and liberty , extending to all in Christ Jesus , condemns hatred , war and bondage . " The document was signed December 27 , 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant . Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony , in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic . The signers indicated their " desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged , neither to condemn least we be condemned , but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master . " Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted . However , John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home . Bowne was arrested , jailed , and sent to the Netherlands for trial ; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne .
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years ( Deflem , 2002 ) . For example , in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals . A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London . The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe , which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War . There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) . It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception . It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( Sheptycki , 2000 ) .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century , and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement ( 1140 ) . The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary , St John and the two patron saints , Cipriano and Cipriana . When the church was demolished in the 19th century , the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia . It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s .
The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha . It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches , each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra , om mani padme hum . At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima , the goddess of smallpox . Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure , walk around the stupa with prayer wheels , chant , and pray . Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex . The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas ( monasteries ) around Boudhanath .
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command , on December 20 , 1944 , he was promoted to General of the Army , equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies . In this and the previous high commands he held , Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy . Although he had never seen action himself , he won the respect of front-line commanders . He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill , Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle . He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy , but these rarely upset his relationships with them . He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov , his Russian counterpart , and they became good friends .
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
In Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 ( 1968 ) , the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime " to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals , " or " to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches " this theory in any school or university that received public funds . The court 's opinion , written by Justice Abe Fortas , ruled that the Arkansas law violated " the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . The overriding fact is that Arkansas ' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine ; that is , with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group . " The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion , and that " [ T ] he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them . "
The mosaics of St. Peter 's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri , Guido Reni , Domenichino , Carlo Maratta , and many others . Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the Transfiguration . Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter 's , including Giovanni Battista Calandra , Fabio Cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and Pietro Paolo Cristofari ( died 1743 ) . Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus , inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition . Yaroslav , the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , Kiev . The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral . It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen , sent by Constantine Monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels . Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above . Below is a Communion of the Apostles .
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap . Mountain building in western North America continued , and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate , isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea . A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe . There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . During the Oligocene , South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America . It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow , rapidly cooling the continent .
Punjab 's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan , the Jhelum , Chenab , Ravi , and Sutlej rivers . There are several mountainous regions , including the Sulaiman Mountains in the southwest part of the province , and Margalla Hills , Salt Range , and Pothohar Plateau in the north . Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment in Punjab ; wheat and cotton are the principal crops . Since independence , Punjab has become the seat of political and economic power ; it remains the most industrialised province of Pakistan . It counts for 39.2 % of large scale manufacturing and 70 % of small scale manufacturing in the country . Its capital Lahore is a major regional cultural , historical , and economic centre .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
Despite the lack of a coastline , Punjab is the most industrialised province of Pakistan ; its manufacturing industries produce textiles , sports goods , heavy machinery , electrical appliances , surgical instruments , vehicles , auto parts , metals , sugar mill plants , aircraft , cement , agricultural machinery , bicycles and rickshaws , floor coverings , and processed foods . In 2003 , the province manufactured 90 % of the paper and paper boards , 71 % of the fertilizers , 69 % of the sugar and 40 % of the cement of Pakistan .
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .
Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays . Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal , which can be detected by some form of instrumentation . Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen . To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases , immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent . For example , immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle . Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism 's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
During the Eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago ) , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . At the beginning of the period , Australia and Antarctica remained connected , and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters , distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high . But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma , the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica , and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents . The Antarctic region cooled down , and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze , sending cold water and ice floes north , reinforcing the cooling . The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago . [ citation needed ]
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos , and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface . A small number of videos , such as the weekly addresses by President Barack Obama , can be downloaded as MP4 files . Numerous third-party web sites , applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos . In February 2009 , YouTube announced a test service , allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout . In June 2012 , Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos . In response , Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site . The default settings when uploading a video to YouTube will retain a copyright on the video for the uploader , but since July 2012 it has been possible to select a Creative Commons license as the default , allowing other users to reuse and remix the material if it is free of copyright .

In the Regal era , a rex sacrorum ( king of the sacred rites ) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king ( rex ) or in his absence , and announced the public festivals . He had little or no civil authority . With the abolition of monarchy , the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased . By the late Republican era , the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia . The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title : his religious duties still included the daily , ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons . First , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified . Second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease . This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR . Third , the essential tools for directing PCR , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of Latin , such as Cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the Greek equivalent Paideia . Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century Italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . Modern scholars , however , point out that Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . For Cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
During the Early Modern period ( approximately late 15th century to 1800 ) , the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth , productivity and innovative research . At the end of the Middle Ages , about 400 years after the first university was founded , there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe . In the 15th century , twenty-eight new ones were created , with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625 . This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe , with the highest concentrations in the German Empire ( 34 ) , Italian countries ( 26 ) , France ( 25 ) , and Spain ( 23 ) – this was close to a 500 % increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages . This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared , or institutions that merged with other universities during this time . It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period , as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions . In fact , the term " university " was not always used to designate a higher education institution . In Mediterranean countries , the term studium generale was still often used , while " Academy " was common in Northern European countries .
Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah’s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines .
Protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . In the nineteenth century , throughout the Anglo-American world , numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . As an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . To Bismarck this was " practical Christianity " . These programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the Western world .
Another scholar contends that the minority leader position emerged even before 1883 . On the Democratic side , " there were serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873 , " indicating that the " nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership . " Further , when Republicans were in the minority , the party nominated for Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers , including ex-Speaker James Blaine of Maine in 1875 , former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio , in 1876 , 1877 , and 1879 , and ex-Speaker Keifer in 1883 . " It is hard to believe that House partisans would place a man in the speakership when in the majority , and nominate him for this office when in the minority , and not look to him for legislative guidance . " This was not the case , according to some observers , with respect to ex-Speaker Keifer .
Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations , including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ , both in the United States and elsewhere . There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide , and the movement is growing in many parts of the world , especially the global South . Since the 1960s , Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions , and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement . Together , Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents .
In December 1943 , President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . The following month , he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 . He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord , the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany .
The Taragaon Museum presents the modern history of the Kathmandu Valley . It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley , documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century . The actual structure of the Museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu . It was designed by Carl Pruscha ( master-planner of the Kathmandy Valley ) in 1970 and constructed in 1971 . Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon hostel into the Taragaon Museum . The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements , as well as the use of circle , triangles and squares . The Museum is within a short walk from the Boudhnath stupa , which itself can be seen from the Museum tower .
According to the 2009 American Community Survey , White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth ( 22.9 % ) of the Bronx 's population . However , non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth ( 12.1 % ) of the population , down from 34.4 % in 1980 . Out of all five boroughs , the Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents . 320,640 whites called the Bronx home , of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites . The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent . People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9 % of the population . People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1 % of the population . German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4 % and 0.8 % of the population respectively .
Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery , exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university , and the ideas of those texts into society generally , their influence was ultimately quite progressive . The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate ( as the notable list of scholars above attests to ) . A focus on knowledge coming from self , from the human , has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction , and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities . This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts , but also their adaptation and expansion . For instance , Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen , but he also invigorated this text with experimentation , disagreements and further research . The propagation of these texts , especially within the universities , was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular , which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices .
Penny Marshall 's 1990 film Awakenings , which was nominated for several Oscars , is based on neurologist Oliver Sacks ' 1973 account of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of encephalitis but briefly responded to the drug L-dopa . Robin Williams played the physician ; Robert De Niro was one of the patients who emerged from a catatonic ( frozen ) state . The home of Williams ' character was shot not far from Sacks ' actual City Island residence . A 1973 Yorkshire Television documentary and " A Kind of Alaska " , a 1985 play by Harold Pinter , were also based on Sacks ' book .
While the decision ( with four dissents ) ultimately upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools , the majority opinion ( by Justice Hugo Black ) and the dissenting opinions ( by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge and Justice Robert H. Jackson ) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a " wall between church and state " or a " separation of Church from State " : their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall . Rutledge , on behalf of the four dissenting justices , took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case : " Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia 's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment , now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth . " Writing separately , Justice Jackson argued that " [ T ] here are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation . In fact , the undertones of the opinion , advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State , seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters . "
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal , displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists . Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts . Art in Kathmandu is vibrant , demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art , derived from a great number of national , Asian , and global influences . Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas : the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet , closely linked to the country 's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting , including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for . Internationally , the British-based charity , the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu .
Subsequent to this decision , the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause , known as the " Lemon Test " . First , the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose . Second , the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . Third , the statute or policy must not result in an " excessive entanglement " of government with religion . ( The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools , and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church 's religious mission , thus the policy involved the state in an " excessive entanglement " with religion . ) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa , Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily . Once Mussolini , the Italian leader , had fallen in Italy , the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche . But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians , the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country – making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of Italy was highly successful .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
During Soviet rule , Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions . The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . In football , their most successful team was Yerevan 's FC Ararat , which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like FC Bayern Munich in the Euro cup .
As the election approached , other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president . In January 1948 , after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention , Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was " not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office " ; " life-long professional soldiers " , he wrote , " in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason , [ should ] abstain from seeking high political office " . Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time . Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president ; Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the other probable winner , would presumably serve two terms , and Eisenhower , at age 66 in 1956 , would then be too old .
Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms ( 1521 ) . In his view , faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could , therefore , not be forced on a person . The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience , and they practised separation of church and state . In the early seventeenth century , Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom . Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke 's stance on tolerance . Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams , Congregationalist Thomas Hooker , and Quaker William Penn , respectively , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion . These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities , including Jews . The United States Declaration of Independence , the United States Constitution , and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework . The great majority of American Protestants , both clergy and laity , strongly supported the independence movement . All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world ( e.g. , Latin America , Japan , and Germany ) . The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette , an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles . The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette 's draft of this document . The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
Renaissance humanism was an activity of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors , book collectors , educators , and writers , who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as umanisti – " humanists " . It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries , and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education , which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic . Scholasticism focused on preparing men to be doctors , lawyers or professional theologians , and was taught from approved textbooks in logic , natural philosophy , medicine , law and theology . There were important centres of humanism at Florence , Naples , Rome , Venice , Mantua , Ferrara , and Urbino .
Eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army 's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy . He was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast . His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System . Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956 .
In Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 ( 1968 ) , the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime " to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals , " or " to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches " this theory in any school or university that received public funds . The court 's opinion , written by Justice Abe Fortas , ruled that the Arkansas law violated " the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . The overriding fact is that Arkansas ' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine ; that is , with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group . " The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion , and that " [ T ] he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them . "
Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff , but did not affect the campaign . One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust . Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage , but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates . The second issue centered on Eisenhower 's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance . Just two weeks prior to the election , Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there . He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO ; finally , he stressed a corruption-free , frugal administration at home .
Jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1879 ) the Court wrote that Jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ First ] Amendment . " In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , Justice Hugo Black wrote : " In the words of Thomas Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state . "
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that Christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . The national motto " In God We Trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . A circuit court ruling affirmed Ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible , " With God , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening . The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it , and miraculously recovered , though he had to repeat his freshman year . He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college , though they lacked the funds . They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions .
Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods , so did some individual Romans . In the mid-to-late Republican era , and probably much earlier , many of Rome 's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult , along with a share of their divinity . Most notably in the very late Republic , the Julii claimed Venus Genetrix as ancestor ; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult . The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil 's poetic , Imperial vision of the past .
In Canada , the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was founded in 1729 , making it the first police force in present-day Canada . It was followed in 1834 by the Toronto Police , and in 1838 by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City . A national force , the Dominion Police , was founded in 1868 . Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament , but its responsibilities quickly grew . The famous Royal Northwest Mounted Police was founded in 1873 . The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Divorce is discouraged , and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery , which they refer to as " a scriptural divorce " . If a divorce is obtained for any other reason , remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality . Extreme physical abuse , willful non-support of one 's family , and what the religion terms " absolute endangerment of spirituality " are considered grounds for legal separation .
It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America . The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement , Nicolaus Zinzendorf , the Moravian Church , Lutheran pietism , Presbyterianism and Puritanism . Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Harold John Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones .
While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948 , actual implementation had been slow . Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953 , saying " I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia , including the Federal Government , and any segregation in the Armed Forces " . When he encountered opposition from the services , he used government control of military spending to force the change through , stating " Wherever Federal Funds are expended ... , I do not see how any American can justify ... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds " .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century , beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity , and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia . The early churches were mostly simple basilicas , but some with side apses . By the fifth century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used . By the seventh century , centrally planned churches had been built and a more complicated niched buttress and radiating Hrip'simé style had formed . By the time of the Arab invasion , most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed .
In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data , Arno Tausch ( Corvinus University of Budapest ) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism . The Global Value Development Index , calculated by Tausch , relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law , no support for shadow economy , postmaterial activism , support for democracy , a non-acceptance of violence , xenophobia and racism , trust in transnational capital and Universities , confidence in the market economy , supporting gender justice , and engaging in environmental activism , etc .
In 295 , a certain Maximilian refused military service ; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath . Both were executed for treason ; both were Christians . At some time around 302 , a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian 's domus and a subsequent ( but undated ) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity . The first ( 303 AD ) " ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts , forbade services to be held , degraded ofﬁcials who were Christians , re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians , and reduced the legal rights of all Christians ... [ Physical ] or capital punishments were not imposed on them " but soon after , several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed . The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice . An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods , in terms that recall the Decian edict .
Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . The agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping . With 18 million international tourists in 2013 , Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world . The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world , with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
When the U.S. entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth , Kansas . In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers . His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps , where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army . He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command – at the site of " Pickett 's Charge " on the Gettysburg , Pennsylvania Civil War battleground . Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat , he displayed excellent organizational skills , as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers ' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel .
Several versions of a semi-official , structured pantheon were developed during the political , social and religious instability of the Late Republican era . Jupiter , the most powerful of all gods and " the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested " , consistently personified the divine authority of Rome 's highest offices , internal organization and external relations . During the archaic and early Republican eras , he shared his temple , some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus , who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva . A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres , Liber and Libera , and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult . Other major and minor deities could be single , coupled , or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure . These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic , part philosophical creations , and often Greek in origin . The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians , and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage .
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent . Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a microbe in a community , and other epidemiological considerations . Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
Democracy , social-contract theory , separation of powers , religious freedom , separation of church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers . Some of the philosophers of the English , Scottish , German , and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , John Toland , David Hume , Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , Christian Wolff , Immanuel Kant , and Jean-Jacques Rousseau - had Protestant backgrounds . For example , John Locke , whose political thought was based on " a set of Protestant Christian assumptions " , derived the equality of all humans , including the equality of the genders ( " Adam and Eve " ) , from Genesis 1 , 26-28 . As all persons were created equally free , all governments needed " the consent of the governed . " These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence , which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation : " We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . "
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology . Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
In the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times , notably in 139 BC and 33 BC . In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " Egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19 . Despite several Imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . In the late 1st century AD , Tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at Rome " .
The neighbourhood of Thamel is Kathmandu 's primary " traveller 's ghetto " , packed with guest houses , restaurants , shops , and bookstores , catering to tourists . Another neighbourhood of growing popularity is Jhamel , a name for Jhamsikhel coined to rhyme with Thamel . Jhochhen Tol , also known as Freak Street , is Kathmandu 's original traveler 's haunt , made popular by the hippies of the 1960s and 1970s ; it remains a popular alternative to Thamel . Asan is a bazaar and ceremonial square on the old trade route to Tibet , and provides a fine example of a traditional neighbourhood .

Punjab 's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan , the Jhelum , Chenab , Ravi , and Sutlej rivers . There are several mountainous regions , including the Sulaiman Mountains in the southwest part of the province , and Margalla Hills , Salt Range , and Pothohar Plateau in the north . Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment in Punjab ; wheat and cotton are the principal crops . Since independence , Punjab has become the seat of political and economic power ; it remains the most industrialised province of Pakistan . It counts for 39.2 % of large scale manufacturing and 70 % of small scale manufacturing in the country . Its capital Lahore is a major regional cultural , historical , and economic centre .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of first-century Christianity . Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body , which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture . The Governing Body does not issue any single , comprehensive " statement of faith " , but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society . Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation , in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose , and that such enlightenment or " new light " results from the application of reason and study , the guidance of the holy spirit , and direction from Jesus Christ and angels . The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern " deep truths " , which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions . The religion 's leadership , while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility , is said to provide " divine guidance " through its teachings described as " based on God 's Word thus ... not from men , but from Jehovah . "
The Portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum . The city has six international schools : American School of Brasília , Brasília International School ( BIS ) , Escola das Nações , Swiss International School ( SIS ) , Lycée français François-Mitterrand ( LfFM ) and Maple Bear Canadian School . August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - The British School of Brasilia . Brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
In November 1942 , he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations ( NATOUSA ) through the new operational Headquarters Allied ( Expeditionary ) Force Headquarters ( A ( E ) FHQ ) . The word " expeditionary " was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons . The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned underground within the Rock of Gibraltar . Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years .
The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make , promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods . Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus ; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson , all bearing the same name , also devoted themselves . Before the battle , Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate . When he offers sacrifice , the victim 's liver appears " damaged where it refers to his own fortunes " . Otherwise , the haruspex tells him , the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods . In a prayer recorded by Livy , Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus , charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks , and is killed ; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering . Had he failed to die , his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void , with possibly disastrous consequences . The act of devotio is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator .
Legendary Princess Bhrikuti ( 7th-century ) and artist Araniko ( 1245 - 1306 AD ) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China . There are over 108 traditional monasteries ( Bahals and Bahis ) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism . Since the 1960s , the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area . Also , with the modernization of Newar Buddhism , various Theravada Bihars have been established .
This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing . Following the airport 's master plan , Infraero built a second runway , which was finished in 2006 . In 2007 , the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers . The main building 's third floor , with 12 thousand square meters , has a panoramic deck , a food court , shops , four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people , and space for exhibitions . Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces . The airport is located about 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) from the central area of Brasília , outside the metro system . The area outside the airport 's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília 's central district . The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars . The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines ( TAM , GOL , Azul , WebJET , Trip and Avianca ) , in addition to a number of international carriers . In 2012 , Brasília 's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium , formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company , with a 50 % stake each . During the 25-year concession , the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life , and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948 . He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game , to the point of golfing during winter ; he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground . He had a small , basic golf facility installed at Camp David , and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts , inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions . Roberts , an investment broker , also handled the Eisenhower family 's investments . Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs , which proved financially lucrative .
Jefferson 's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case Reynolds v. U.S. , in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison , seeking a legal definition for the word religion . Writing for the majority , Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson 's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that " Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion , but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . " Considering this , the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings , individually and collectively , and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence ( rationalism , empiricism ) over acceptance of dogma or superstition . The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it . Generally , however , humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress . In modern times , humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism , and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time , a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , only 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville , Dauphin County , Pennsylvania . In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service . In retirement , the former president did not completely retreat from political life ; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg . However , his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as " a dime-store New Dealer " .
According to Der Spiegel , credits given to European governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives . A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that " The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " In previous years , Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank . " These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines . In May 2010 , the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and Great Britain third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP during 2010 .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
In 1999 , the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification , apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation , although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement . This is understandable , since there is no compelling authority within them . On 18 July 2006 , delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration .
The Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14 . Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern . Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta . The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96 . In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .
The clearance of the pathogens , either treatment-induced or spontaneous , it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients . For instance , for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b ( brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron ) combined with ribavirin , it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene , encoding interferon lambda 3 , are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus . This finding , originally reported in Nature , showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others . Later report from Nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus .
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . Among these groups , many Irish Americans , Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here . In addition , French , German , Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . The Jewish population also increased notably during this time . In 1937 , according to Jewish organizations , 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011 . Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
In the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one party , the Speaker normally assumes a lower profile and defers to the President . For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a de facto " leader of the opposition " , often more so than the Senate Minority Leader , due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership . Minority Leaders who have played prominent roles in opposing the incumbent President have included Gerald Ford , Richard Gephardt , Nancy Pelosi , and John Boehner .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
Public priests were appointed by the collegia . Once elected , a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine , which offered him lifetime influence , privilege and immunity . Therefore , civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family . Religious law was collegial and traditional ; it informed political decisions , could overturn them , and was difficult to exploit for personal gain . Priesthood was a costly honour : in traditional Roman practice , a priest drew no stipend . Cult donations were the property of the deity , whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds . For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum , permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime 's service in military or political life , or preferably both : it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty . For a freedman or slave , promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile , and opportunities in local politics ; and therefore business . During the Imperial era , priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office ; in effect , it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum . In Rome , the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren , once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities , then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms . The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays , accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt . Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year , provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
In Miranda the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest . The court held that " The prosecution may not use statements , whether exculpatory or inculpatory , stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way , unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment 's privilege against self-incrimination "
A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious , miniature mosaic icons . In these icons the small tesserae ( with sides of 1 mm or less ) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel . These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion . The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century . The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle , humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century .
Exhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage . The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions are held . It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .
Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by Edward Burne-Jones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome . Another modern mosaic of note is the world 's largest mosaic installation located at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis , located in St. Louis , Missouri . A modern example of mosaic is the Museum of Natural History station of the New York City Subway ( there are many such works of art scattered throughout the New York City subway system , though many IND stations are usually designed with bland mosaics . ) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some Texas interstate highways .
Counting shipping as quasi-exports and in terms of monetary value , Greece ranked 4th globally in 2011 having " exported " shipping services worth 17,704.132 million $ ; only Denmark , Germany and South Korea ranked higher during that year . Similarly counting shipping services provided to Greece by other countries as quasi-imports and the difference between " exports " and " imports " as a " trade balance " , Greece in 2011 ranked in the latter second behind Germany , having " imported " shipping services worth 7,076.605 million US $ and having run a " trade surplus " of 10,712.342 million US $ .
The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century , stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort : " The law of love , peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews , Turks and Egyptians , as they are considered sons of Adam , which is the glory of the outward state of Holland , so love , peace and liberty , extending to all in Christ Jesus , condemns hatred , war and bondage . " The document was signed December 27 , 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant . Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony , in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic . The signers indicated their " desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged , neither to condemn least we be condemned , but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master . " Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted . However , John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home . Bowne was arrested , jailed , and sent to the Netherlands for trial ; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne .
By the end of the early modern period , the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context . Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging . The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture , and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
The word " police " was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century , but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces . The word , and the concept of police itself , were " disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression " ( according to Britannica 1911 ) . Before the 19th century , the first use of the word " police " recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798 .
Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences . Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . Concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . While YouTube 's revenue-sharing " Partner Program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels " . In 2013 Forbes ' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media . In 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega " , " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo . By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a " place of palaces " . There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur . The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , Kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty . The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square . The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap , Kumari Ghar , and Shiva-Parvati Temple ; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace . The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 Nepal earthquake .
The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower 's resignation in December 1950 , when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe . Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31 , 1952 , and he resumed his presidency of Columbia . He held this position until January 20 , 1953 , when he became the President of the United States .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
Sociologist Rodney Stark states that Jehovah 's Witness leaders are " not always very democratic " and that members " are expected to conform to rather strict standards , " but adds that " enforcement tends to be very informal , sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group " , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as " part of the power structure rather than subject to it . " Sociologist Andrew Holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah 's Witnesses have made an informed choice . However , he also states that defectors " are seldom allowed a dignified exit " , and describes the administration as autocratic .
Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature . Published in 2008 , The World In Grey : Dom Bosco 's Prophecy , by author Ryan J. Lucero , tells an apocalypticle story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco . According to Don Bosco 's prophecy : " Between parallels 15 and 20 , around a lake which shall be formed ; A great civilization will thrive , and that will be the Promised Land . " Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S , where an artificial lake ( Paranoá Lake ) was formed . Don Bosco is Brasília 's patron saint .
Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms ( 1521 ) . In his view , faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could , therefore , not be forced on a person . The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience , and they practised separation of church and state . In the early seventeenth century , Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom . Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke 's stance on tolerance . Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams , Congregationalist Thomas Hooker , and Quaker William Penn , respectively , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion . These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities , including Jews . The United States Declaration of Independence , the United States Constitution , and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework . The great majority of American Protestants , both clergy and laity , strongly supported the independence movement . All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world ( e.g. , Latin America , Japan , and Germany ) . The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette , an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles . The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette 's draft of this document . The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition .
Just as artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci – partaking of the zeitgeist though not himself a humanist – advocated study of human anatomy , nature , and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art , so Spanish-born humanist Juan Luis Vives ( c. 1493–1540 ) advocated observation , craft , and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities , helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism . Thus , the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to natural philosophy , based on empirical observations and experimentation of the physical universe , making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance .
Punjab ( Urdu , Punjabi : پنجاب , panj-āb , " five waters " : listen ( help·info ) ) , also spelled Panjab , is the most populous of the four provinces of Pakistan . It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres ( 79,284 square miles ) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011 , approximately 56 % of the country 's total population . Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore . Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east . In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south , Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north .
The Bronx 's evolution from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop was the subject of an award-winning documentary , produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS in 2006 , " From Mambo to Hip Hop : A South Bronx Tale " . Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s . The New York Times has identified 1520 Sedgwick Avenue " an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway " as a starting point , where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community room .
On 31 October 1517 , Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints ' , the Castle Church in Wittenberg . The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy , but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory , particular judgment , and the authority of the pope . He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary , the intercession of and devotion to the saints , the sacraments , mandatory clerical celibacy , monasticism , further on the authority of the pope , the ecclesiastical law , censure and excommunication , the role of secular rulers in religious matters , the relationship between Christianity and the law , good works , and the sacraments .
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
In 1899 , the memorial , by the Berlin sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter ( 1846–1917 ) , finally came to rest , although subject to repeated vandalism , in the Bronx , at 164th Street and the Grand Concourse , or Joyce Kilmer Park near today 's Yankee Stadium . ( In 1999 , it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse . ) In 2007 , Christopher Gray of The New York Times described it as " a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei , the mythical German figure , surrounded by mermaids , dolphins and seashells . "
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
Mosaic has a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine . Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance , though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique . Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
In parts of Italy , which were under eastern artistic influences , like Sicily and Venice , mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages . The whole interior of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate , golden mosaics . The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries . The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century . One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark 's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis , a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople ( 1204 ) . The mosaics were executed in the 1220s .
In many ways , the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period . During the Paleocene , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents . Europe and Greenland were still connected . North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge , while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate . The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west , which ended in the succeeding epoch . South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas ( they joined during the Neogene ) ; the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart , with Africa , South America , Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other . Africa was heading north toward Europe , slowly closing the Tethys Ocean , and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma . The period was a time of great tectonic activity , as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together . The continent Euramerica ( or Laurussia ) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica , which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn . In these near-deserts , the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed , made red by the oxidized iron ( hematite ) characteristic of drought conditions . Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe , further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana . The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere . Sea levels were high worldwide , and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas . The deep , enormous Panthalassa ( the " universal ocean " ) covered the rest of the planet . Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys , Proto-Tethys , Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean ( which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica ) .
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
The largest ethnic groups are Newar ( 29.6 % ) , Matwali ( 25.1 % Sunuwar , Gurung , Magars , Tamang etc . ) , Khas Brahmins ( 20.51 % ) and Chettris ( 18.5 % ) . Tamangs originating from surrounding hill districts can be seen in Kathmandu . More recently , other hill ethnic groups and Caste groups from Terai have come to represent a substantial proportion of the city 's population . The major languages are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa , while English is understood by many , particularly in the service industry . The major religions are Hinduism and Buddhism .
Maharaja Ranjit Singh 's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state . Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down , starting the First Anglo-Sikh War ; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to British India . After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 , the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India . In Jhelum 35 British soldiers of HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . [ citation needed ]
A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . Their powers include the legitimized use of force . The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
The second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . Though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers . Because sola scriptura placed the Bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between Christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was Christocentric .
The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor . The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933 , 1937 and 1941 ( and in the latter two elections , only because his 30-32 % vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22-23 % as a Republican ) . The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 . The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31 % of the Bronx 's vote , putting him second and well ahead of the 20 % won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel , who came in second ( ahead of Hillquit ) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2 % to 21.7 % .
IMF 's forecast said that Greece 's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014 . But in fact , the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployemnt . The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009 , and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013 . In 2015 , Greece 's jobless rate is around 24 per cent . It is thought that Greece 's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Starting in the 1970s , the Bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " The Bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film . The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series , when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers . Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire . As the fire was captured on live television , announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " There it is , ladies and gentlemen : the Bronx is burning " . Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
According to Eurostat , Greece 's largest port by tons of goods transported in 2010 is the port of Aghioi Theodoroi , with 17.38 million tons . The Port of Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons , followed by the Port of Piraeus , with 13.2 million tons , and the port of Eleusis , with 12.37 million tons . The total number of goods transported through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million tons , a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the country in 2007 . Since then , Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean 's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO . In 2013 , Piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world .
The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south , although the northern ( primarily Germany , France and Great Britain ) and southern universities ( primarily Italy ) did have many elements in common . Latin was the language of the university , used for all texts , lectures , disputations and examinations . Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic , natural philosophy , and metaphysics ; while Hippocrates , Galen , and Avicenna were used for medicine . Outside of these commonalities , great differences separated north and south , primarily in subject matter . Italian universities focused on law and medicine , while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology . There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus , so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means . There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities . English , French and German universities usually awarded bachelor 's degrees , with the exception of degrees in theology , for which the doctorate was more common . Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates . The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions , while in the south students often went on to professional positions . The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris . Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna . Among the southern universities , a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy , which followed the pattern of Bologna as a " self-regulating , independent corporation of scholars " and those of southern Italy and Iberia , which were " founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government . "
After a visit to Brasília , the French writer Simone de Beauvoir complained that all of its superquadras exuded " the same air of elegant monotony , " and other observers have equated the city 's large open lawns , plazas , and fields to wastelands . As the city has matured , some of these have gained adornments , and many have been improved by landscaping , giving some observers a sense of " humanized " spaciousness . Although not fully accomplished , the " Brasília utopia " has produced a city of relatively high quality of life , in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure ( the superquadras ) flanked by small commercial areas , bookstores and cafes ; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
Witnesses believe that a " little flock " go to heaven , but that the hope for life after death for the majority of " other sheep " involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon . They interpret Revelation 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000 , who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth . Jehovah 's Witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon , but that God is the final judge . During Christ 's millennial reign , most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever ; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium .
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
The phrase " [ A ] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world " was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams , the founder of the colony of Rhode Island , in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution . The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government , in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) :
Internal party disunity compounded the difficulty of identifying lawmakers who might have informally functioned as a minority leader . For instance , " seven of the fourteen speakership elections from 1834 through 1859 had at least twenty different candidates in the field . Thirty-six competed in 1839 , ninety-seven in 1849 , ninety-one in 1859 , and 138 in 1855 . " With so many candidates competing for the speakership , it is not at all clear that one of the defeated lawmakers then assumed the mantle of " minority leader . " The Democratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not " nominate a candidate for Speaker in two of these seven Congresses and nominated no man more than once in the other five . The defeated candidates were not automatically looked to for leadership . "
Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader , the House Majority Leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House . Typically , the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . In some cases , Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker ; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert . In addition , Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor .
Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been " fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution " , TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that " what Gutenberg did for writing , online video can now do for face-to-face communication " . Anderson asserted that it 's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance , and that video contributors may be about to launch " the biggest learning cycle in human history . " In education , for example , the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan 's cousin into what Forbes ' Michael Noer called " the largest school in the world " , with technology poised to disrupt how people learn .
The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85 . The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . They were laid down in the Umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
Provide Campaign Assistance . Minority leaders are typically energetic and aggressive campaigners for partisan incumbents and challengers . There is hardly any major aspect of campaigning that does not engage their attention . For example , they assist in recruiting qualified candidates ; they establish " leadership PACs " to raise and distribute funds to House candidates of their party ; they try to persuade partisan colleagues not to retire or run for other offices so as to hold down the number of open seats the party would need to defend ; they coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national party campaign committees ; they encourage outside groups to back their candidates ; they travel around the country to speak on behalf of party candidates ; and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant financial contributions to the party 's campaign committee . " The amount of time that [ Minority Leader ] Gephardt is putting in to help the DCCC [ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] is unheard of , " noted a Democratic lobbyist . " No DCCC chairman has ever had that kind of support . "
The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings . Unpredictable weather is expected , given that temperatures can drop to 1 °C ( 34 °F ) or less during the winter . During a 2013 cold front , the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to −4 °C ( 25 °F ) , and the lowest temperature was recorded on January 10 , 2013 , at −9.2 °C ( 15.4 °F ) . Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based ( about 65 % of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August ) , and decreases substantially ( 100 to 200 cm ( 39 to 79 in ) ) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal . Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres ( 55.1 in ) for the Kathmandu valley , and averages 1,407 millimetres ( 55.4 in ) for the city of Kathmandu . On average humidity is 75 % . The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology , " Weather Meteorology " for 2005 . The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month . The annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres ( 44.3 in ) for 2005 , as per monthly data included in the table above . The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu . This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon . [ citation needed ] For example , 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu , totalling over 2,900 mm ( 114 in ) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season . In contrast , 2001 recorded only 356 mm ( 14 in ) of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season .
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented . After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium , in a stone chamber " which had on a previous occasion [ 228 BC ] also been polluted by human victims , a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings " . Livy avoids the word " sacrifice " in connection with this bloodless human life-offering ; Plutarch does not . The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC , preparatory to an invasion of Gaul . Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain .
The Bronx street grid is irregular . Like the northernmost part of upper Manhattan , the West Bronx 's hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid . Much of the West Bronx 's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan , but does not match it exactly ; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx . This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx River , was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris , where student members are controlled by faculty " masters , " provided a standard for universities , the application of this model took at least three different forms . There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum ; this model tended to train specialists . There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature . There were also universities that combined these models , using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization .
Punjab is Pakistan 's second largest province in terms of land area at 205,344 km2 ( 79,284 sq mi ) , after Balochistan , and is located at the north western edge of the geologic Indian plate in South Asia . The province is bordered by Kashmir ( Azad Kashmir , Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir , India ) to the northeast , the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east , the Pakistani province of Sindh to the south , the province of Balochistan to the southwest , the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the north .
Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . Ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . Witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins .
The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball . The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue , a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships . With the famous facade , the short right field porch and Monument Park , Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball 's greatest players including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Whitey Ford , Yogi Berra , Mickey Mantle , Reggie Jackson , Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes . There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome . During the Roman Republic ( 509–27 BC ) , the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs . Priests married , raised families , and led politically active lives . Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul . The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order , thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny . The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods , especially Jupiter , who embodied just rule . As a result of the Punic Wars ( 264–146 BC ) , when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power , many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
At about the same time , the word " humanism " as a philosophy centred on humankind ( as opposed to institutionalised religion ) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians , Arnold Ruge , and Karl Marx , who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government . There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms : philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history ; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
Several versions of a semi-official , structured pantheon were developed during the political , social and religious instability of the Late Republican era . Jupiter , the most powerful of all gods and " the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested " , consistently personified the divine authority of Rome 's highest offices , internal organization and external relations . During the archaic and early Republican eras , he shared his temple , some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus , who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva . A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres , Liber and Libera , and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult . Other major and minor deities could be single , coupled , or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure . These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic , part philosophical creations , and often Greek in origin . The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians , and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
In parts of Italy , which were under eastern artistic influences , like Sicily and Venice , mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages . The whole interior of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate , golden mosaics . The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries . The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century . One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark 's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis , a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople ( 1204 ) . The mosaics were executed in the 1220s .
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite Bronx High School of Science , Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music , DeWitt Clinton High School , High School for Violin and Dance , Bronx Leadership Academy 2 , Bronx International High School , the School for Excellence , the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study , Wings Academy for young adults , The Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice , Validus Preparatory Academy , The Eagle Academy For Young Men , Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School , Bronx Academy of Letters , Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School of American Studies . The Bronx is also home to three of New York City 's most prestigious private , secular schools : Fieldston , Horace Mann , and Riverdale Country School .
Others , such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . However , the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily . The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina . The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor . Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos .
The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower , Nikita Khrushchev , Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident . Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev 's demands that he apologize . Therefore , Khrushchev would not take part in the summit . Up until this event , Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union . Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit . Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that " stupid U-2 business " .
In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
Like the Speaker of the House , the Minority Leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position . When Nancy Pelosi , D-CA , became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress , she had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress . When her predecessor , Richard Gephardt , D-MO , became minority leader in the 104th House , he had been in the House for almost 20 years , had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years , had been a 1988 presidential candidate , and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections . Gephardt 's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel , R-IL , who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House . Michel 's predecessor , Republican John Rhodes of Arizona , was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .
In a video posted on July 21 , 2009 , YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos . The videos can be viewed in several different ways , including the common anaglyph ( cyan/red lens ) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect . The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows , columns or a checkerboard pattern , side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan , green/magenta or blue/yellow combination . In May 2011 , an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision .
Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries , most notably with Nicolas Delamare 's Traité de la Police ( " Treatise on the Police " ) , first published in 1705 . The German Polizeiwissenschaft ( Science of Police ) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police . Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften ( 1937 ) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however , this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault 's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850 .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
The clearance of the pathogens , either treatment-induced or spontaneous , it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients . For instance , for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b ( brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron ) combined with ribavirin , it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene , encoding interferon lambda 3 , are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus . This finding , originally reported in Nature , showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others . Later report from Nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus .
In December 1943 , President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . The following month , he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 . He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord , the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time , a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , only 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville , Dauphin County , Pennsylvania . In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service . In retirement , the former president did not completely retreat from political life ; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg . However , his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as " a dime-store New Dealer " .
Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings , individually and collectively , and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence ( rationalism , empiricism ) over acceptance of dogma or superstition . The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it . Generally , however , humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress . In modern times , humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism , and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world .
Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings , according to the principle do ut des ( " I give , that you might give " ) . Proper , respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity . Religious neglect was a form of atheism : impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia ( impious errors ) . Excessive devotion , fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio . Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger ( ira deorum ) and therefore harm the State . The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions , and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors . Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values .
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a " place of palaces " . There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur . The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , Kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty . The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square . The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap , Kumari Ghar , and Shiva-Parvati Temple ; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace . The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 Nepal earthquake .
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . For example , humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
Episcopalians and Presbyterians , as well as other WASPs , tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated ( having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita ) than most other religious groups in United States , and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business , law and politics , especially the Republican Party . Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors , Rockefeller , Du Pont , Roosevelt , Forbes , Whitneys , the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families .
The Taragaon Museum presents the modern history of the Kathmandu Valley . It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley , documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century . The actual structure of the Museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu . It was designed by Carl Pruscha ( master-planner of the Kathmandy Valley ) in 1970 and constructed in 1971 . Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon hostel into the Taragaon Museum . The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements , as well as the use of circle , triangles and squares . The Museum is within a short walk from the Boudhnath stupa , which itself can be seen from the Museum tower .
Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children . He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law . The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights . Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation , they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875 .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress , with results , " often the reverse of what he has desired " because Members of Congress , " resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this ' . The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking . "
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence . During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones . Almost nothing of them survived except the " Ascension of Christ " in the Latin Chapel ( now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics ) . More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ , Councils of the Church and angels . In the apses the Annunciation , the Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen . The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor , the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church .
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
To a large extent , the minority leader 's position is a 20th-century innovation . Prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized , so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader . Decades went by before anything like the modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders . However , from the beginning days of Congress , various House members intermittently assumed the role of " opposition leader . " Some scholars suggest that Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned as the first " minority leader " because in the First Congress he led the opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton 's fiscal policies .
The name Anabaptist , meaning " one who baptizes again " , was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants . Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants . The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist , claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void , the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism . As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues , Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics . [ aa ] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount , which precluded taking oaths , participating in military actions , and participating in civil government , some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise . [ ab ] They were thus technically Anabaptists , even though conservative Amish , Mennonites , and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism . Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front . Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden , Thomas Müntzer , Kaspar Schwenkfeld , Sebastian Franck , Menno Simons . Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck , Conrad Grebel , Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz .
The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of New York City in the state of New York , located south of Westchester County . Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River , as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens . Of the five boroughs , the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
In the 1990s , New York City began closing the large , public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools . Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety . Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include John F. Kennedy , James Monroe , Taft , Theodore Roosevelt , Adlai Stevenson , Evander Childs , Christopher Columbus , Morris , Walton , and South Bronx High Schools . More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools , also replacing them with smaller schools .

Dwight David " Ike " Eisenhower ( /ˈaɪzənˌhaʊ.ər/ EYE-zən-HOW-ər ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was an American politician and general who served as the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 . He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe . He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front . In 1951 , he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data , Arno Tausch ( Corvinus University of Budapest ) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism . The Global Value Development Index , calculated by Tausch , relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law , no support for shadow economy , postmaterial activism , support for democracy , a non-acceptance of violence , xenophobia and racism , trust in transnational capital and Universities , confidence in the market economy , supporting gender justice , and engaging in environmental activism , etc .
When the Majority Leader 's party loses control of the House , and if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy , convention suggests that they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip , respectively . As the minority party has one less leadership position after losing the speaker 's chair , there may be a contest for the remaining leadership positions . Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker seeking the Minority Leader post to retain the House party leadership , as the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections . Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran successfully for Minority Leader in the 112th Congress .
Energy production in Greece is dominated by the Public Power Corporation ( known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ , or in English DEI ) . In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6 % of all energy demand in Greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . Almost half ( 48 % ) of DEI 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009 . Another 12 % comes from Hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . Between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010 .
With the initial investment of £4,200 , the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades , of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and " on the game . " The force was a success after its first year , and his men had " established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives . " Word of this success spread quickly , and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800 , transforming it from a private to public police agency ; now the oldest police force in the world . Colquhoun published a book on the experiment , The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames . It found receptive audiences far outside London , and inspired similar forces in other cities , notably , New York City , Dublin , and Sydney .
An exceptionally well preserved , carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany , the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390 . Because of its purely geometrical pattern , the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas , especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem . A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor .

On August 27 , 2013 , YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature . Embedding , rating , commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner .
In the 1960 election to choose his successor , Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President , Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy . He told friends , " I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy . " He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days , although he may have done Nixon some harm . When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , Eisenhower joked , " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " Kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy . Eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as Kennedy was 43 .
Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader , the House Majority Leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House . Typically , the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . In some cases , Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker ; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert . In addition , Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor .
The second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . Though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers . Because sola scriptura placed the Bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between Christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was Christocentric .
Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature . Published in 2008 , The World In Grey : Dom Bosco 's Prophecy , by author Ryan J. Lucero , tells an apocalypticle story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco . According to Don Bosco 's prophecy : " Between parallels 15 and 20 , around a lake which shall be formed ; A great civilization will thrive , and that will be the Promised Land . " Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S , where an artificial lake ( Paranoá Lake ) was formed . Don Bosco is Brasília 's patron saint .
The ad fontes principle also had many applications . The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism , and Neoplatonism , whose Pagan wisdom the humanists , like the Church fathers of old , tended , at least initially , to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue . The line from a drama of Terence , Homo sum , humani nihil a me alienum puto ( or with nil for nihil ) , meaning " I am a human being , I think nothing human alien to me " , known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine , gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude . The statement , in a play modeled or borrowed from a ( now lost ) Greek comedy by Menander , may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man 's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning , by Cicero and Saint Augustine , to name a few , and most notably by Seneca . Richard Bauman writes :
In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
The economic output of the metropolitan area alone is worth more than one third of national GDP around $ 6.5billion in terms of nominal GDP NR.s 550 billion approximately per year $ 2200 per capital income approx three times national average . Kathmandu exports handicrafts , artworks , garments , carpets , pashmina , paper ; trade accounts for 21 % of its finances. [ which ? ] Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19 % of the revenue that Kathmandu generates . Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products . Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture ( 9 % ) , education ( 6 % ) , transport ( 6 % ) , and hotels and restaurants ( 5 % ) . Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls .
The city of Kathmandu is named after Kasthamandap temple , that stood in Durbar Square . In Sanskrit , Kastha ( काष्ठ ) means " wood " and Mandap ( /मण्डप ) means " covered shelter " . This temple , also known as Maru Satal in the Newar language , was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla . The two-storey structure was made entirely of wood , and used no iron nails nor supports . According to legend , all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree . The structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
Russell moved the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters to Brooklyn , New York , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel . He identified the religious movement as " Bible Students , " and more formally as the International Bible Students Association . By 1910 , about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re-elected him annually as their " pastor . " Russell died October 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour .
The Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056 . The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived ( Theotokos with raised hands , four evangelists with seraphim , scenes from Christ 's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos ) . In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures , detail , landscape and setting .
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government , such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates ( 2007 ) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video , with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape . Describing the Arab Spring ( 2010- ) , sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist 's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using " Facebook to schedule the protests , Twitter to coordinate , and YouTube to tell the world . " In 2012 , more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the " Kony 2012 " video was posted to YouTube , with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video " will do more to lead to ( Kony 's ) demise than all other action combined . "
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings . Unpredictable weather is expected , given that temperatures can drop to 1 °C ( 34 °F ) or less during the winter . During a 2013 cold front , the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to −4 °C ( 25 °F ) , and the lowest temperature was recorded on January 10 , 2013 , at −9.2 °C ( 15.4 °F ) . Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based ( about 65 % of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August ) , and decreases substantially ( 100 to 200 cm ( 39 to 79 in ) ) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal . Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres ( 55.1 in ) for the Kathmandu valley , and averages 1,407 millimetres ( 55.4 in ) for the city of Kathmandu . On average humidity is 75 % . The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology , " Weather Meteorology " for 2005 . The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month . The annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres ( 44.3 in ) for 2005 , as per monthly data included in the table above . The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu . This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon . [ citation needed ] For example , 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu , totalling over 2,900 mm ( 114 in ) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season . In contrast , 2001 recorded only 356 mm ( 14 in ) of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season .
The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways ' in his honor . It was inspired in part by Eisenhower 's own Army experiences in World War II , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . Commemorative signs reading " Eisenhower Interstate System " and bearing Eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System . Several highways are also named for him , including the Eisenhower Expressway ( Interstate 290 ) near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
In the Presidential primary elections of February 5 , 2008 , Sen. Clinton won 61.2 % of the Bronx 's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8 % for Barack Obama and 1.0 % for the other four candidates combined ( John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Bill Richardson and Joe Biden ) . On the same day , John McCain won 54.4 % of the borough 's 5,643 Republican votes , Mitt Romney 20.8 % , Mike Huckabee 8.2 % , Ron Paul 7.4 % , Rudy Giuliani 5.6 % , and the other candidates ( Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes ) 3.6 % between them .
Believers in Pashupatinath ( mainly Hindus ) are allowed to enter the temple premises , but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River . The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka , South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla . This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam ( Unified India ) by encouraging cultural exchange . This procedure is followed in other temples around India , which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church’s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
In his book , Humanism ( 1997 ) , Tony Davies calls these critics " humanist anti-humanists " . Critics of antihumanism , most notably Jürgen Habermas , counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism 's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal , they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own . Others , like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks , but thought humanism applied only to the German " race " and specifically to the Nazis and thus , in Davies ' words , were anti-humanist humanists . Such a reading of Heidegger 's thought is itself deeply controversial ; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism . Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century " it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man ' or the 'triumph of human reason ' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them " . For " it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason " . Yet , he continues , " it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms . For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution . The freedom to speak and write , to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests , to protest and disobey : all these can only be articulated in humanist terms . "
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors : the Central Sector , the East Sector , the North Sector , the City Core and the West Sector . For civic administration , the city is further divided into 35 administrative wards . The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members . It holds biannual meetings to review , process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions . The ward 's profile documents for the 35 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population , the structure and condition of houses , the type of roads , educational , health and financial institutions , entertainment facilities , parking space , security provisions , etc . It also includes lists of development projects completed , on-going and planned , along with informative data about the cultural heritage , festivals , historical sites and the local inhabitants . Ward 16 is the largest , with an area of 437.4 ha ; ward 26 is the smallest , with an area of 4 ha .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman religio . The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons , the apparent shrinking of the sun 's disc , two moons in a daylit sky , a cosmic battle between sun and moon , a rain of red-hot stones , a bloody sweat on statues , and blood in fountains and on ears of corn : all were expiated by sacrifice of " greater victims " . The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural ; sheep become goats , a hen become a cock ( and vice versa ) – these were expiated with " lesser victims " . The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina , singing a hymn to avert disaster : a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation . Religious restitution is proved only by Rome 's victory .
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece’s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece’s Eurozone entry .
Official cults were state funded as a " matter of public interest " ( res publica ) . Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . The difference between public and private cult is often unclear . Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . Some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole . All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and pontifices .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , in what the leadership calls a " theocratic organization " , reflecting their belief that it is God 's " visible organization " on earth . The organization is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size , but since early 2014 has comprised seven members , [ note 1 ] all of whom profess to be of the " anointed " class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the Watch Tower Society 's Brooklyn headquarters . There is no election for membership ; new members are selected by the existing body . Until late 2012 , the Governing Body described itself as the representative and " spokesman " for God 's " faithful and discreet slave class " ( approximately 10,000 self-professed " anointed " Jehovah 's Witnesses ) . At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society , the " faithful and discreet slave " was defined as referring to the Governing Body only . The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions , including publishing , assembly programs and evangelizing activities . It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers , after they have been recommended by local branches , with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions . Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants , and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
The Bronx street grid is irregular . Like the northernmost part of upper Manhattan , the West Bronx 's hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid . Much of the West Bronx 's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan , but does not match it exactly ; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx . This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx River , was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence . During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones . Almost nothing of them survived except the " Ascension of Christ " in the Latin Chapel ( now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics ) . More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ , Councils of the Church and angels . In the apses the Annunciation , the Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen . The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor , the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church .
The Licchavis from the Indo-Gangetic plain migrated north and defeated the Kiratas , establishing the Licchavi dynasty . During this era , following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka , the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas . From Sankhu , they migrated to Yambu and Yengal ( Lanjagwal and Manjupattan ) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu . This created the basis of Newar Buddhism , which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world . With their migration , Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram during most of the Licchavi era .
On March 31 , 2010 , the YouTube website launched a new design , with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site . Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented : " We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter . " In May 2010 , it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day , which it described as " nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined " . In May 2011 , YouTube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day . In January 2012 , YouTube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
In Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) , the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause . The court 's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable , " the court wrote . " Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a " wall , " is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
A Vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and Roman matron and wife . Unlike male priests , Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of Rome .
In contrast to the Proterozoic , Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments , such as graywackes , mudstones , volcanic sediments and banded iron formations . Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations , consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks . The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs , while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin . In short , greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents .
Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous animistic practices of Nepal . It is practiced by Kirat people . Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs , such as ancestor worship ( worship of Ajima ) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin . Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats , such as Pashupatinath , Wanga Akash Bhairabh ( Yalambar ) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu . Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice Mundhum in the city .
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
Soteriologically , most Methodists are Arminian , emphasizing that Christ accomplished salvation for every human being , and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it ( as opposed to the traditional Calvinist doctrine of monergism ) . Methodism is traditionally low church in liturgy , although this varies greatly between individual congregations ; the Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition ; John Wesley 's brother , Charles , was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church , and many other eminent hymn writers come from the Methodist tradition .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .

Rome had no separate priestly caste or class . The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices , officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes . Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation . In household cult , the paterfamilias functioned as priest , and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants . Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise . The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines ( the singular is flamen ) , attributed to king Numa : the major flamines , dedicated to Jupiter , Mars and Quirinus , were traditionally drawn from patrician families . Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity , whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some . Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity ; Jupiter 's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career .
Each of Rome 's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic . Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests . The first " outsider " Etruscan king , Lucius Tarquinius Priscus , founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter , Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world . The benevolent , divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League , its Aventine Temple to Diana , and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms . Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus , whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates .
During the French Revolution , and soon after , in Germany ( by the Left Hegelians ) , humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind , without attention to the transcendent or supernatural . The designation Religious Humanism refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . It is similar to Protestantism , although centered on human needs , interests , and abilities rather than the supernatural . In the Anglophone world , such modern , organized forms of humanism , which are rooted in the 18th-century Enlightenment , have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts .
Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . Practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . In 2003 , Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship , one of the categories of free flying . In August 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship .
The 1981 film Fort Apache , The Bronx is another film that used the Bronx 's gritty image for its storyline . The movie 's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed " Fort Apache " . Also from 1981 is the horror film Wolfen making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures . Knights of the South Bronx , a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children , is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005 . The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film Fuga dal Bronx , also known as Bronx Warriors 2 and Escape 2000 , an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series Mystery Science Theatre 3000 . The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation 's plans to depopulate , destroy and redevelop the Bronx , and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation 's murderous ways and save their homes . The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase , " Leave the Bronx ! " Many of the movie 's scenes were filmed in Queens , substituting as the Bronx . Rumble in the Bronx was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film , another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences . Last Bronx , a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo , where crime and gang warfare is rampant .
The mosaics of St. Peter 's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri , Guido Reni , Domenichino , Carlo Maratta , and many others . Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the Transfiguration . Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter 's , including Giovanni Battista Calandra , Fabio Cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and Pietro Paolo Cristofari ( died 1743 ) . Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command , on December 20 , 1944 , he was promoted to General of the Army , equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies . In this and the previous high commands he held , Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy . Although he had never seen action himself , he won the respect of front-line commanders . He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill , Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle . He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy , but these rarely upset his relationships with them . He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov , his Russian counterpart , and they became good friends .
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions , which they consider a violation of God 's law based on their interpretation of Acts 15:28 , 29 and other scriptures . Since 1961 the willing acceptance of a blood transfusion by an unrepentant member has been grounds for expulsion from the religion . Members are directed to refuse blood transfusions , even in " a life-or-death situation " . Jehovah 's Witnesses accept non-blood alternatives and other medical procedures in lieu of blood transfusions , and their literature provides information about non-blood medical procedures .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
Organizations including Viacom , Mediaset , and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube , claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material . Viacom , demanding $ 1 billion in damages , said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " . YouTube responded by stating that it " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
Historians trace the earliest church labeled Baptist back to 1609 in Amsterdam , with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the mid-18th century , the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South . The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership , as did the preachers ' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery , which had been part of the 18th-century teachings . Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent .
The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) .
In parts of Italy , which were under eastern artistic influences , like Sicily and Venice , mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages . The whole interior of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice is clad with elaborate , golden mosaics . The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries . The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century . One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark 's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis , a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople ( 1204 ) . The mosaics were executed in the 1220s .
Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination . More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient . Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype . Other techniques ( such as X-rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent . The images are useful in detection of , for example , a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion .
Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science . In fact , more than 80 % of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained , of which approximately 45 % held university posts . It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable , and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development . There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system , which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world . However , university professors still utilized some autonomy , at least in the sciences , to choose epistemological foundations and methods . For instance , Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction . Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .
Among Ike 's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) into McCarthy 's witch hunt for communists , which would interfere with , and perhaps delay , the AEC 's important work on H-bombs . The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC , J. Robert Oppenheimer , had urged that the H-bomb work be delayed . Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance , though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .

Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( scholae monasticae ) , in which monks and nuns taught classes ; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century . The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools . It is possible , however , that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare , with the University of Paris being an exception . Later they were also founded by Kings ( University of Naples Federico II , Charles University in Prague , Jagiellonian University in Kraków ) or municipal administrations ( University of Cologne , University of Erfurt ) . In the early medieval period , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools , usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education . Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries .
After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . From that point on , Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution . During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century , “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms” , regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State , and therefore threatened its existence . The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism ; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework . Christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950 , the hotel industry drastically improved . Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury such as the Hyatt Regency , Dwarika 's , theYak & Yeti , The Everest Hotel , Hotel Radisson , Hotel De L'Annapurna , The Malla Hotel , Shangri-La Hotel ( which is not operated by the Shangri-La Hotel Group ) and The Shanker Hotel . There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali , Hotel Narayani , The Blue Star and Grand Hotel . The Garden Hotel , Hotel Ambassador , and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu . Hotels like Hyatt Regency , De L'Annapurna and Hotel Yak & Yeti are among the five-star hotels providing casinos as well .
Punjab has the largest economy in Pakistan , contributing most to the national GDP . The province 's economy has quadrupled since 1972 . Its share of Pakistan 's GDP was 54.7 % in 2000 and 59 % as of 2010 . It is especially dominant in the service and agriculture sectors of Pakistan 's economy . With its contribution ranging from 52.1 % to 64.5 % in the Service Sector and 56.1 % to 61.5 % in the agriculture sector . It is also major manpower contributor because it has largest pool of professionals and highly skilled ( technically trained ) manpower in Pakistan . It is also dominant in the manufacturing sector , though the dominance is not as huge , with historical contributions raging from a low of 44 % to a high of 52.6 % . In 2007 , Punjab achieved a growth rate of 7.8 % and during the period 2002–03 to 2007–08 , its economy grew at a rate of between 7 % to 8 % per year . and during 2008–09 grew at 6 % against the total GDP growth of Pakistan at 4 % .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . In 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns .
Contemporary humanism entails a qualified optimism about the capacity of people , but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely good or that all people can live up to the Humanist ideals without help . If anything , there is recognition that living up to one 's potential is hard work and requires the help of others . The ultimate goal is human flourishing ; making life better for all humans , and as the most conscious species , also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole . The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now , and leaving the world a better place for those who come after . In 1925 , the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned : " The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled ; and man , who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels , has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature . It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts " .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
Jeffries and Ryan ( 2001 ) argue that the modern concept of separation of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court . The central point , they argue , was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools , followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education . Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause .
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen system , with two distinct seasons : the rainy season , from October to April , and a dry season , from May to September . The average temperature is 20.6 °C ( 69.1 °F ) . September , at the end of the dry season , has the highest average maximum temperature , 28.3 °C ( 82.9 °F ) , has major and minor lower maximum average temperature , of 25.1 °C ( 77.2 °F ) and 12.9 °C ( 55.2 °F ) , respectively . Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C ( 72 °F ) . With 247.4 mm ( 9.7 in ) , January is the month with the highest rainfall of the year , while June is the lowest , with only 8.7 mm ( 0.3 in ) .
The Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the President of Brazil . The palace was designed , along with the rest of the city of Brasília , by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958 . One of the first structures built in the republic 's new capital city , the " Alvorada " lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Paranoá . The principles of simplicity and modernity , that in the past characterized the great works of architecture , motivated Niemeyer . The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box , softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns . The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement , landing , and second floor . The auditorium , kitchen , laundry , medical center , and administration offices are at basement level . The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing . The second floor has four suites , two apartments , and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace . The building also has a library , a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool , a music room , two dining rooms and various meeting rooms . A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball . The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue , a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships . With the famous facade , the short right field porch and Monument Park , Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball 's greatest players including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Whitey Ford , Yogi Berra , Mickey Mantle , Reggie Jackson , Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
The phrase " [ A ] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world " was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams , the founder of the colony of Rhode Island , in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution . The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government , in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) :
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
On 31 October 1517 , Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints ' , the Castle Church in Wittenberg . The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy , but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory , particular judgment , and the authority of the pope . He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary , the intercession of and devotion to the saints , the sacraments , mandatory clerical celibacy , monasticism , further on the authority of the pope , the ecclesiastical law , censure and excommunication , the role of secular rulers in religious matters , the relationship between Christianity and the law , good works , and the sacraments .
Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children . He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law . The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights . Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation , they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875 .
Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " I give that you might give . " Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .

However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
During the late 1920s and early 1930s , Eisenhower 's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat , as military priorities diminished ; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs . He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing , and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower , then a journalist at the Agriculture Department , he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe . He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928 . After a one-year assignment in France , Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely , Assistant Secretary of War , from 1929 to February 1933 . Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Industrial College ( Washington , DC ) in 1933 and later served on the faculty ( it was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy ) .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of God . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . They consider the Bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist Andrew Holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body , through Watch Tower Society publications , carry almost as much weight as the Bible . Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended ; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . Adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding . " The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( " all the sea " ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean . The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age ; in the U.S. , these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup . Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass , Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in Western Europe , where the Triassic was first studied . In North America , for example , marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west . Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments , such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates .
Augustus ' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals . They were given high-status seating at games and theatres . The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia , wife of Augustus . They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century , after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians . When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , he took steps toward the dissolution of the order . His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta 's sacred fire and vacated her temple .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize . However , as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church , all other sacraments ( except marriage ) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid . Therefore , Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized ( although they are confirmed ) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study .
In May 2007 , YouTube launched its Partner Program , a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site . YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program , with 55 percent going to the uploader . There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program . According to TubeMogul , in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube ( one that is shown before the video starts ) cost advertisers on average $ 7.60 per 1000 views . Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement , due to a lack of interested advertisers . Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos , a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $ 7.60 X 55 % = $ 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 .
Between 1975 and 2009 , Olympic Airways ( known after 2003 as Olympic Airlines ) was the country’s state-owned flag carrier , but financial problems led to its privatization and relaunch as Olympic Air in 2009 . Both Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air have won awards for their services ; in 2009 and 2011 , Aegean Airlines was awarded the " Best regional airline in Europe " award by Skytrax , and also has two gold and one silver awards by the ERA , while Olympic Air holds one silver ERA award for " Airline of the Year " as well as a " Condé Nast Traveller 2011 Readers Choice Awards : Top Domestic Airline " award .
At the 2009 American Community Survey , Black Americans made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos . Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third ( 35.4 % ) of the Bronx 's population . Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8 % of the population . Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough , of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks . Over 61,000 people identified themselves as " Sub-Saharan African " in the survey , making up 4.4 % of the population .
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean . In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean , the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the Proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . Roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , 600–540 Ma .
Mosaic has a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine . Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance , though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique . Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics .
The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960 . A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858 . Each of the designs incorporates the text " with appreciation " or " with personal and official gratitude " accompanied with Eisenhower 's initials " D.D.E . " or facsimile signature . The design also incorporates location , date , and/or significant event . Prior to the end of his second term as President , 1,451 medals were turned-in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed . The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series .
As of June 2012 [ update ] , Pakistan 's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab . According to protesters , load shedding was depriving the cities of electricity 20–22 hours a day , causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard . Gujranwala , Toba Tek Singh , Faisalabad , Sialkot , Bahawalnagar and communities across Khanewal District saw widespread rioting and violence on Sunday 17 June 2012 , with the houses of several members of parliament being attacked as well as the offices of regional energy suppliers Fesco , Gepco and Mepco being ransacked or attacked .
They can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as Brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . A " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in South Africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .

Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to Republic and to Empire . Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . In the early Republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia . The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . Plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . In principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . In reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond .
Raymond B. Bragg , the associate editor of The New Humanist , sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead , Charles Francis Potter , and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference . Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 . Potter 's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
The small woolen dolls called Maniae , hung on the Compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania , as Mother of the Lares . The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus , traditionally Rome 's Republican founder and first consul . Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example .
Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950 , the hotel industry drastically improved . Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury such as the Hyatt Regency , Dwarika 's , theYak & Yeti , The Everest Hotel , Hotel Radisson , Hotel De L'Annapurna , The Malla Hotel , Shangri-La Hotel ( which is not operated by the Shangri-La Hotel Group ) and The Shanker Hotel . There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali , Hotel Narayani , The Blue Star and Grand Hotel . The Garden Hotel , Hotel Ambassador , and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu . Hotels like Hyatt Regency , De L'Annapurna and Hotel Yak & Yeti are among the five-star hotels providing casinos as well .
In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 7.2 % it accounted for in 2006 , but still below the EU average of 10 % in 2008 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . In 2013 and for several months , Greece produced more than 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways ' in his honor . It was inspired in part by Eisenhower 's own Army experiences in World War II , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . Commemorative signs reading " Eisenhower Interstate System " and bearing Eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System . Several highways are also named for him , including the Eisenhower Expressway ( Interstate 290 ) near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
At the time , there were many varying opinions about Christian doctrine , and no centralized way of enforcing orthodoxy . Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting , and some 318 bishops ( very few from the Western Empire ) attended the First Council of Nicaea . The purpose of this meeting was to define Christian orthodoxy and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies . The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed and other statements . Later , Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine . Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties .
There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level . In 1773 , Isaac Backus , a prominent Baptist minister in New England , wrote against a state sanctioned religion , saying : " Now who can hear Christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? " He also observed that when " church and state are separate , the effects are happy , and they do not at all interfere with each other : but where they have been confounded together , no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued . " Thomas Jefferson 's influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786 , five years before the Bill of Rights .
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .

In the American Old West , policing was often of very poor quality . [ citation needed ] The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organized posses . [ citation needed ] Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors , notably the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , which was hired by individuals , businessmen , local governments and the federal government . At its height , the Pinkerton Agency 's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army . [ citation needed ]
Between 2005 and 2011 , Greece has had the highest percentage increase in industrial output compared to 2005 levels out of all European Union members , with an increase of 6 % . Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010 , with domestic output decreasing by 5.8 % and industrial production in general by 13.4 % . Currently , Greece is ranked third in the European Union in the production of marble ( over 920,000 tons ) , after Italy and Spain .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
Of the Christian minority in Egypt over 90 % belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church . Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church , the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations . Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria , such as the Syro-Lebanese , who belong to Greek Catholic , Greek Orthodox , and Maronite Catholic denominations .
The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower 's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency . Meanwhile , Columbia University 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including Leonard McCollum , the president of Continental Oil ; Frank Abrams , the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey ; Bob Kleberg , the president of the King Ranch ; H. J. Porter , a Texas oil executive ; Bob Woodruff , the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation ; and Clarence Francis , the chairman of General Foods .
The Armenians collective has , at times , constituted a Christian " island " in a mostly Muslim region . There is , however , a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims , known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race , while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years . The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States . Later on , the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin , the original seat of the Catholicosate . In 1441 , a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi , while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia . Therefore , since 1441 , there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges , and with their respective jurisdictions . The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia .
The word " police " was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century , but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces . The word , and the concept of police itself , were " disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression " ( according to Britannica 1911 ) . Before the 19th century , the first use of the word " police " recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798 .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
In the United States , their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties . Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference , the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service , the right of patients to refuse medical treatment , and the right to engage in public discourse . Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada .
Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by Edward Burne-Jones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome . Another modern mosaic of note is the world 's largest mosaic installation located at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis , located in St. Louis , Missouri . A modern example of mosaic is the Museum of Natural History station of the New York City Subway ( there are many such works of art scattered throughout the New York City subway system , though many IND stations are usually designed with bland mosaics . ) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some Texas interstate highways .
On January 17 , 1961 , Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office . In his farewell speech , Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces . He described the Cold War : " We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ... " and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that " we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military–industrial complex . "
In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command , on December 20 , 1944 , he was promoted to General of the Army , equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies . In this and the previous high commands he held , Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy . Although he had never seen action himself , he won the respect of front-line commanders . He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill , Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle . He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy , but these rarely upset his relationships with them . He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov , his Russian counterpart , and they became good friends .

The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series .
The onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . June and July are oppressively hot . Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °C , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °C . In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . The hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late October .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
According to the 2009 American Community Survey , White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth ( 22.9 % ) of the Bronx 's population . However , non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth ( 12.1 % ) of the population , down from 34.4 % in 1980 . Out of all five boroughs , the Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents . 320,640 whites called the Bronx home , of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites . The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent . People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9 % of the population . People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1 % of the population . German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4 % and 0.8 % of the population respectively .
Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations , including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ , both in the United States and elsewhere . There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide , and the movement is growing in many parts of the world , especially the global South . Since the 1960s , Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions , and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement . Together , Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents .
The city has a unique status in Brazil , as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other cities in Brazil . The name 'Brasília ' is commonly used as a synonym for the Federal District through synecdoche ; However , the Federal District is composed of 31 administrative regions , only one of which is Brasília proper , with a population of 209,926 in a 2011 survey ; Demographic publications generally do not make this distinction and list the population of Brasília as synonymous with the population of the Federal District , considering the whole of it as its metropolitan area . The city was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Additionally , Brasília hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
Some legal scholars , such as John Baker of LSU , theorize that Madison 's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " —was rejected by the House , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists . To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown . During the debate over the establishment clause , Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison 's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious , miniature mosaic icons . In these icons the small tesserae ( with sides of 1 mm or less ) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel . These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion . The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century . The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle , humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century .
Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris , where student members are controlled by faculty " masters , " provided a standard for universities , the application of this model took at least three different forms . There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum ; this model tended to train specialists . There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature . There were also universities that combined these models , using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization .
In terms of ship categories , Greek companies have 22.6 % of the world 's tankers and 16.1 % of the world 's bulk carriers ( in dwt ) . An additional equivalent of 27.45 % of the world 's tanker dwt is on order , with another 12.7 % of bulk carriers also on order . Shipping accounts for an estimated 6 % of Greek GDP , employs about 160,000 people ( 4 % of the workforce ) , and represents 1/3 of the country 's trade deficit . Earnings from shipping amounted to €14.1 billion in 2011 , while between 2000 and 2010 Greek shipping contributed a total of €140 billion ( half of the country 's public debt in 2009 and 3.5 times the receipts from the European Union in the period 2000–2013 ) . The 2011 ECSA report showed that there are approximately 750 Greek shipping companies in operation .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
On the domestic front , he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege . He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President , Richard Nixon . He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security . He also launched the Interstate Highway System , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act , and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948 , actual implementation had been slow . Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953 , saying " I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia , including the Federal Government , and any segregation in the Armed Forces " . When he encountered opposition from the services , he used government control of military spending to force the change through , stating " Wherever Federal Funds are expended ... , I do not see how any American can justify ... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds " .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide , [ ad ] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians . [ ae ] In 2010 , a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa , 260 million in the Americas , 140 million in Asia-Pacific region , 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa . Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population . Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world 's Christians at 33 % , 36 % , 36.7 % , and 40 % , while in relation to the world 's population at 11.6 % and 13 % .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .
But in the mid-18th century , during the French Enlightenment , a more ideological use of the term had come into use . In 1765 , the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of " The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us , and which we will venture to call 'humanism ' , for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing " . The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots " philanthropic " and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge ( some Christian , some not ) . After the French Revolution , the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions , attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau , was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives , such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre , as a deification or idolatry of humanity . Humanism began to acquire a negative sense . The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word " humanism " by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the " mere humanity " ( as opposed to the divine nature ) of Christ , i.e. , Unitarians and Deists . In this polarised atmosphere , in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise , universal schooling , and the like , liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity . The anarchist Proudhon ( best known for declaring that " property is theft " ) used the word " humanism " to describe a " culte , déification de l’humanité " ( " worship , deification of humanity " ) and Ernest Renan in L’avenir de la science : pensées de 1848 ( " The Future of Knowledge : Thoughts on 1848 " ) ( 1848–49 ) , states : " It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future , that is , the cult of all that pertains to humanity—all of life , sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value . "
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
They can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as Brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . A " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in South Africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington , where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany . He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division ( WPD ) , General Leonard T. Gerow , and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division . Next , he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division ( which replaced WPD ) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . The size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma . During the early Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana ; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow , while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana itself rifted apart . The Tethys Sea closed , and the Neotethys basin appeared . Climates were warm , with no evidence of glaciation . As in the Triassic , there was apparently no land near either pole , and no extensive ice caps existed . The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe , where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas ; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen . In contrast , the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic , with few outcrops at the surface . Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic , most exposed sediments from this period are continental , such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation . The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic , marking the Nevadan orogeny . Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia , India , South America , Japan , Australasia and the United Kingdom .
The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .
Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions ( e.g. , influenza ) . Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted . Other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection , such as vector transmission or sexual transmission , are usually not regarded as " contagious " , and often do not require medical isolation ( sometimes loosely called quarantine ) of victims . However , this specialized connotation of the word " contagious " and " contagious disease " ( easy transmissibility ) is not always respected in popular use .
With high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . Rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( CAD ) software can be assembled by a robot . Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . But these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . With robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders . When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah 's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt , provide help and possibly administer discipline . Disfellowshipping , a form of shunning , is the strongest form of discipline , administered to an offender deemed unrepentant . Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home , and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement ; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged . Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that " losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [ the shunned individual ] to come 'to his senses , ' see the seriousness of his wrong , and take steps to return to Jehovah . " The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior . Members who disassociate ( formally resign ) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned . Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced . Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin ; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service , but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship . Marking , a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship , is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin . [ note 4 ]
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia . The city is located in an ancient lake basin , with fertile soil and flat terrain . This geography helped form a society based on agriculture . This , combined with its location between India and China , helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries . Kathmandu 's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet . From centuries past , Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia . Other traditional occupations are farming , metal casting , woodcarving , painting , weaving , and pottery .
Jefferson 's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity , but this was a caricature . In setting up the University of Virginia , Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own , though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity , arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom . Some have argued that this arrangement was " fully compatible with Jefferson 's views on the separation of church and state ; " however , others point to Jefferson 's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation . Still other scholars , such as Mark David Hall , attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean . In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean , the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the Proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . Roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , 600–540 Ma .
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era . Rulers from Tirhut , upon being attacked by Muslims , fled north to the Kathmandu valley . They intermarried with Nepali royalty , and this led to the Malla era . The early years of the Malla era were turbulent , with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims . There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu 's population , including the king Abhaya Malla . These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era ( such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan ) , and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city . Despite the initial hardships , Kathmandu rose to prominence again and , during most of the Malla era , dominated the trade between India and Tibet . Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade .
Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled , working-class , urban culture . Hollywood films such as From This Day Forward ( 1946 ) , set in Highbridge , occasionally delved into Bronx life . Paddy Chayefsky 's Academy Award-winning Marty was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film The Catered Affair , and in the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri film , A Bronx Tale , Spike Lee 's 1999 movie Summer of Sam , centered in an Italian-American Bronx community , 1994 's I Like It Like That that takes place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx , and Doughboys , the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother 's gambling debts .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian 's reign . The figures , animals , plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background . The portrait of a moustached man , probably a Gothic chieftain , is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age . The so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II 's reign around 565–577 . Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room . The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition . There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki ( 5th–6th centuries ) .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
Regardless of the way the tension between universities , individual scientists , and the scientific revolution itself is perceived , there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed . Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction , but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting . The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution , and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation , initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines . Instead of entering higher education to become a " general scholar " immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum , there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself . The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge .
The Bronx street grid is irregular . Like the northernmost part of upper Manhattan , the West Bronx 's hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid . Much of the West Bronx 's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan , but does not match it exactly ; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx . This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx River , was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church’s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that Christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . The national motto " In God We Trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . A circuit court ruling affirmed Ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible , " With God , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
When the White House is controlled by the House majority party , then the House minority leader assumes a larger role in formulating alternatives to executive branch initiatives and in acting as a national spokesperson for his or her party . " As Minority Leader during [ President Lyndon Johnson 's ] Democratic administration , my responsibility has been to propose Republican alternatives , " said Minority Leader Gerald Ford , R-MI . Greatly outnumbered in the House , Minority Leader Ford devised a political strategy that allowed Republicans to offer their alternatives in a manner that provided them political protection . As Ford explained :
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
Police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention . This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead , especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict ( Goldsmith and Sheptycki , 2007 ) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions ( Hills , 2009 ) .
There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide , [ ad ] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians . [ ae ] In 2010 , a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa , 260 million in the Americas , 140 million in Asia-Pacific region , 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa . Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population . Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world 's Christians at 33 % , 36 % , 36.7 % , and 40 % , while in relation to the world 's population at 11.6 % and 13 % .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
The great Navicella mosaic ( 1305–1313 ) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter 's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone . The giant mosaic , commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi , was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard . It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters . This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter 's in the 17th century . Navicella means " little ship " referring to the large boat which dominated the scene , and whose sail , filled by the storm , loomed over the horizon . Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
With the abatement of persecution , St. Jerome acknowledged the Empire as a bulwark against evil but insisted that " imperial honours " were contrary to Christian teaching . His was an authoritative but minority voice : most Christians showed no qualms in the veneration of even " pagan " emperors . The peace of the emperors was the peace of God ; as far as the Church was concerned , internal dissent and doctrinal schism were a far greater problem . The solution came from a hitherto unlikely source : as pontifex maximus Constantine I favoured the " Catholic Church of the Christians " against the Donatists because :
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
Between 2005 and 2011 , Greece has had the highest percentage increase in industrial output compared to 2005 levels out of all European Union members , with an increase of 6 % . Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010 , with domestic output decreasing by 5.8 % and industrial production in general by 13.4 % . Currently , Greece is ranked third in the European Union in the production of marble ( over 920,000 tons ) , after Italy and Spain .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada . Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization , more than 4000 years ago . The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa . The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation . The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River . This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan . Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found . Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas , Achaemenids , Macedonians , Mauryas , Kushans , Guptas , and Hindu Shahi . It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time , otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire . Agriculture flourished and trading cities ( such as Multan and Lahore ) grew in wealth .
Larry Christenson , a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro , California , did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans . A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in Minneapolis . Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential ; especially " Hosanna ! " in Lakeville , and North Heights in St. Paul . The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the Alliance of Renewal Churches . There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach . Richard A. Jensen 's Touched by the Spirit published in 1974 , played a major role of the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 . In November 2006 , it was bought by Google for US $ 1.65 billion . YouTube now operates as one of Google 's subsidiaries . The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
Officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " The practice was a mark of the " Other " , attributed to Rome 's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls . Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain . Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere .
His primary duty was planning for the next war , which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression . He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur , Army Chief of Staff . In 1932 , he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington , D.C . Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it , he later wrote the Army 's official incident report , endorsing MacArthur 's conduct .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel , who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ . In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exhaltation of Adam . In the apse the Ascension of Christ . The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
The humanists ' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods . By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin , they applied the principle of ad fontes , or back to the sources , across broad areas of learning , seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors . In 1439 , while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon ( at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States ) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis , now called philology , to prove that the Donation of Constantine , which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome , was an 8th-century forgery . For the next 70 years , however , neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way . Instead , after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453 , which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy , humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism , hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches , and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world . The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts , not only of Plato and Aristotle , but also of the Christian Gospels , previously unavailable in the Latin West .
Most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . However , it was the retroactive application of ESA95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by Eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of GDP , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . This led to claims that Greece ( similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
The metro leaves the Rodoviária ( bus station ) and goes south , avoiding most of the political and tourist areas . The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities , such as Samambaia , Taguatinga and Ceilândia , as well as Guará and Águas Claras . The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself ( the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants , Taguatinga had 243,575 , whereas the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants ) , and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation .
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented . After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium , in a stone chamber " which had on a previous occasion [ 228 BC ] also been polluted by human victims , a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings " . Livy avoids the word " sacrifice " in connection with this bloodless human life-offering ; Plutarch does not . The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC , preparatory to an invasion of Gaul . Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain .
Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers . Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards . It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk , sugar and spices . Alcohol is widely drunk , and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages . Drinking and driving is illegal , and authorities have a zero tolerance policy . Ailaa and thwon ( alcohol made from rice ) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu , found in all the local bhattis ( alcohol serving eateries ) . Chhyaang , tongba ( fermented millet or barley ) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu . However , shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers .
Baptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and that it must be done by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or sprinkling ) . Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency ( liberty ) , salvation through faith alone , Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice , and the autonomy of the local congregation . Baptists recognize two ministerial offices , pastors and deacons . Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches , though some Baptists disavow this identity .
On March 31 , 2010 , the YouTube website launched a new design , with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site . Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented : " We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter . " In May 2010 , it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day , which it described as " nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined " . In May 2011 , YouTube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day . In January 2012 , YouTube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day .
The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma . During the early Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana ; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow , while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana itself rifted apart . The Tethys Sea closed , and the Neotethys basin appeared . Climates were warm , with no evidence of glaciation . As in the Triassic , there was apparently no land near either pole , and no extensive ice caps existed . The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe , where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas ; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen . In contrast , the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic , with few outcrops at the surface . Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic , most exposed sediments from this period are continental , such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation . The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic , marking the Nevadan orogeny . Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia , India , South America , Japan , Australasia and the United Kingdom .
Each of Rome 's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic . Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests . The first " outsider " Etruscan king , Lucius Tarquinius Priscus , founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter , Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world . The benevolent , divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League , its Aventine Temple to Diana , and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms . Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus , whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates .

In his book , Humanism ( 1997 ) , Tony Davies calls these critics " humanist anti-humanists " . Critics of antihumanism , most notably Jürgen Habermas , counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism 's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal , they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own . Others , like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks , but thought humanism applied only to the German " race " and specifically to the Nazis and thus , in Davies ' words , were anti-humanist humanists . Such a reading of Heidegger 's thought is itself deeply controversial ; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism . Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century " it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man ' or the 'triumph of human reason ' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them " . For " it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason " . Yet , he continues , " it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms . For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution . The freedom to speak and write , to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests , to protest and disobey : all these can only be articulated in humanist terms . "
The neighbourhood of Thamel is Kathmandu 's primary " traveller 's ghetto " , packed with guest houses , restaurants , shops , and bookstores , catering to tourists . Another neighbourhood of growing popularity is Jhamel , a name for Jhamsikhel coined to rhyme with Thamel . Jhochhen Tol , also known as Freak Street , is Kathmandu 's original traveler 's haunt , made popular by the hippies of the 1960s and 1970s ; it remains a popular alternative to Thamel . Asan is a bazaar and ceremonial square on the old trade route to Tibet , and provides a fine example of a traditional neighbourhood .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
In the high Renaissance , in fact , there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity , including the writings of the Church fathers , the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels , and in some cases even the Jewish Kabbalah , would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement . With this end in view , Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought . One humanist , the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho ( 1355–1452 ) , based in Mystras , Greece ( but in contact with humanists in Florence , Venice , and Rome ) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism .
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington , where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany . He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division ( WPD ) , General Leonard T. Gerow , and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division . Next , he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division ( which replaced WPD ) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff , but did not affect the campaign . One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust . Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage , but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates . The second issue centered on Eisenhower 's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance . Just two weeks prior to the election , Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there . He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO ; finally , he stressed a corruption-free , frugal administration at home .
Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings , according to the principle do ut des ( " I give , that you might give " ) . Proper , respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity . Religious neglect was a form of atheism : impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia ( impious errors ) . Excessive devotion , fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio . Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger ( ira deorum ) and therefore harm the State . The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions , and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors . Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values .
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah 's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory . In 1933 , there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses in Germany , of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned . Of those , 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . In Canada , Jehovah 's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent . In the former Soviet Union , about 9,300 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951 . Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including China , Vietnam and some Islamic states .
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
During the Permian all the Earth 's major land masses , except portions of East Asia , were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea . Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles , with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ( Panthalassa , the universal sea ) , and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana . The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink . A new ocean was growing on its southern end , the Tethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era . Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ( " continental climate " ) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns . Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances . Some rituals specifically required the presence of women , but their active participation was limited . As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice , the central rite of most major public ceremonies . In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals , some cult practices were reserved for women only . The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely . Because women enter the public record less frequently than men , their religious practices are less known , and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias . A host of deities , however , are associated with motherhood . Juno , Diana , Lucina , and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent .
A pater familias was the senior priest of his household . He offered daily cult to his lares and penates , and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth . His wife ( mater familias ) was responsible for the household 's cult to Vesta . In rural estates , bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines ( lararia ) and their deities . Household cults had state counterparts . In Vergil 's Aeneid , Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the lares and penates from Troy , along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .
Starting in the 1970s , the Bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " The Bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film . The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series , when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers . Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire . As the fire was captured on live television , announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " There it is , ladies and gentlemen : the Bronx is burning " . Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
The phrase " [ A ] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world " was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams , the founder of the colony of Rhode Island , in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution . The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government , in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) :
Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , Armenia was an independent republic . In late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army , and in 1922 , Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union , later forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 1936 to September 21 , 1991 ) . In 1991 , Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured . All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host . An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin . Neither of these colonizations are considered infections . The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance . Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions , and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection . Some colonizing bacteria , such as Corynebacteria sp . and viridans streptococci , prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host , preventing infection and speeding wound healing .
On March 31 , 2010 , the YouTube website launched a new design , with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site . Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented : " We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter . " In May 2010 , it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day , which it described as " nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined " . In May 2011 , YouTube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day . In January 2012 , YouTube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day .
That evening , Eisenhower 's body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene , Kansas , the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an American president . His body arrived on April 2 , and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library . The president 's body was buried as a General of the Army . The family used an $ 80 standard soldier 's casket , and dressed Eisenhower 's body in his famous short green jacket . His only medals worn were : the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , and the Legion of Merit . Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud , who died at age 3 in 1921 . His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979 .
Each of Rome 's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic . Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests . The first " outsider " Etruscan king , Lucius Tarquinius Priscus , founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter , Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world . The benevolent , divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League , its Aventine Temple to Diana , and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms . Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus , whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates .
The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County , one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York . The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers , Eastchester , and Pelham . In 1846 , a new town , West Farms , was created by division of Westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of Morrisania was created from West Farms . In 1873 , the town of Kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge , Riverdale , and Woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of Yonkers .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
But in the mid-18th century , during the French Enlightenment , a more ideological use of the term had come into use . In 1765 , the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of " The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us , and which we will venture to call 'humanism ' , for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing " . The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots " philanthropic " and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge ( some Christian , some not ) . After the French Revolution , the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions , attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau , was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives , such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre , as a deification or idolatry of humanity . Humanism began to acquire a negative sense . The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word " humanism " by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the " mere humanity " ( as opposed to the divine nature ) of Christ , i.e. , Unitarians and Deists . In this polarised atmosphere , in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise , universal schooling , and the like , liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity . The anarchist Proudhon ( best known for declaring that " property is theft " ) used the word " humanism " to describe a " culte , déification de l’humanité " ( " worship , deification of humanity " ) and Ernest Renan in L’avenir de la science : pensées de 1848 ( " The Future of Knowledge : Thoughts on 1848 " ) ( 1848–49 ) , states : " It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future , that is , the cult of all that pertains to humanity—all of life , sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value . "
Since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the Bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " Ten-Year Housing Plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units . The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos ' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx . The IRT White Plains Road Line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . Chains such as Marshalls , Staples , and Target opened stores in the Bronx . More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .
Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children . He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law . The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights . Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation , they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875 .
Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942 . Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . He organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . Knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding Witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code .
In the 2005 OECD report for Greece , it was clearly stated that " the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece 's ] EMU membership qualification " . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece 's application , and thus the criteria had been met .
Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that " Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making . " Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles . They were diverse in style , rich in color and ornamental motifs , and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them , such as artsvagorgs ( eagle-carpets ) , vishapagorgs ( dragon-carpets ) and otsagorgs ( serpent-carpets ) . The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches , " covered with vegatative ornaments " , and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh .
Counting shipping as quasi-exports and in terms of monetary value , Greece ranked 4th globally in 2011 having " exported " shipping services worth 17,704.132 million $ ; only Denmark , Germany and South Korea ranked higher during that year . Similarly counting shipping services provided to Greece by other countries as quasi-imports and the difference between " exports " and " imports " as a " trade balance " , Greece in 2011 ranked in the latter second behind Germany , having " imported " shipping services worth 7,076.605 million US $ and having run a " trade surplus " of 10,712.342 million US $ .
The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar , who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy ; he was murdered soon after . Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors , and offered similar cult to Caesar 's successor , Augustus , who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship ; it might prove fatal . By the end of his reign , Augustus had appropriated Rome 's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his " reformed " and thoroughly integrated system of government . Towards the end of his life , he cautiously allowed cult to his numen . By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed , first in the Eastern Provinces , then in the West . Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context ; bathhouses , shrines and temples to Roman and local deities , amphitheatres and festivals . In the early Imperial period , the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship .
The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world . Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music . In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called " kef " style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular . This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated . Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional " kef " style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of " kef music " heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time . Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia . Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry . Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan . Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent . In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .

Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions , many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx . The New York City Department of Education manages public noncharter schools in the borough . In 2000 , public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx 's residents over 3 years old ( out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools ) . There are also several public charter schools . Private schools range from élite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations .
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma . During the early Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana ; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow , while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana itself rifted apart . The Tethys Sea closed , and the Neotethys basin appeared . Climates were warm , with no evidence of glaciation . As in the Triassic , there was apparently no land near either pole , and no extensive ice caps existed . The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe , where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas ; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen . In contrast , the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic , with few outcrops at the surface . Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic , most exposed sediments from this period are continental , such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation . The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic , marking the Nevadan orogeny . Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia , India , South America , Japan , Australasia and the United Kingdom .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely , particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany . They included nonconformists like the Puritans , who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England . Despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches . The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established Church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .

The style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the White House , the general political climate in the House , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . Despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . Many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book . Others have devolved upon the position in other ways . To be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him or her as a Representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
Sociologist Rodney Stark states that Jehovah 's Witness leaders are " not always very democratic " and that members " are expected to conform to rather strict standards , " but adds that " enforcement tends to be very informal , sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group " , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as " part of the power structure rather than subject to it . " Sociologist Andrew Holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah 's Witnesses have made an informed choice . However , he also states that defectors " are seldom allowed a dignified exit " , and describes the administration as autocratic .
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
Kathmandu is dissected by eight rivers , the main river of the valley , the Bagmati and its tributaries , of which the Bishnumati , Dhobi Khola , Manohara Khola , Hanumant Khola , and Tukucha Khola are predominant . The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the elevation range of 1,500–3,000 metres ( 4,900–9,800 ft ) , and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley . An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu ; this canal is now extinct .
In contrast to the Proterozoic , Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments , such as graywackes , mudstones , volcanic sediments and banded iron formations . Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations , consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks . The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs , while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin . In short , greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents .
In 1758 , the general of the Hindu Maratha Empire , Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Attock . Timur Shah Durrani , the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali , was driven out of Punjab . Lahore , Multan , Dera Ghazi Khan , Kashmir and other subahs on the south and eastern side of Peshawar were under the Maratha rule for the most part . In Punjab and Kashmir , the Marathas were now major players . The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 1761 , Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded the Maratha territory of Punjab and captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and re-consolidated control over them .
Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis , Washington . In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce . In June 1941 , he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger , Commander of the 3rd Army , at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3 , 1941 . Although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
In November 1956 , Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British , French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis , receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt . Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
Tourism is considered another important industry in Nepal . This industry started around 1950 , as the country 's political makeup changed and ended the country 's isolation from the rest of the world . In 1956 , air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway , between Kathmandu and Raxaul ( at India 's border ) , was started . Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity ; some of these include the Tourism Development Board , the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department . Furthermore , Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations . Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity . The hotel industry , travel agencies , training of tourist guides , and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal , and in Kathmandu in particular .
In Canada , the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was founded in 1729 , making it the first police force in present-day Canada . It was followed in 1834 by the Toronto Police , and in 1838 by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City . A national force , the Dominion Police , was founded in 1868 . Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament , but its responsibilities quickly grew . The famous Royal Northwest Mounted Police was founded in 1873 . The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
In the American Old West , policing was often of very poor quality . [ citation needed ] The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organized posses . [ citation needed ] Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors , notably the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , which was hired by individuals , businessmen , local governments and the federal government . At its height , the Pinkerton Agency 's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army . [ citation needed ]
When the Majority Leader 's party loses control of the House , and if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy , convention suggests that they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip , respectively . As the minority party has one less leadership position after losing the speaker 's chair , there may be a contest for the remaining leadership positions . Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker seeking the Minority Leader post to retain the House party leadership , as the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections . Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran successfully for Minority Leader in the 112th Congress .
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries , including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal . Nepal 's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions , Hinduism and Buddhhism . These are amply reflected in the many temples , shrines , stupas , monasteries , and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur . The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day , including archeological exportation .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement . Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots , it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles . From there it spread around the world , carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there . These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history , such as seen in the two Great Awakenings . Pentecostalism , which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations , continues to be an important force in Western Christianity .
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . The size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . By 1992 , with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe ( Joubert and Bevers , 1996 ) .
Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília . The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras ( " superblocks " ) : groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools , retail stores , and open spaces . At the northern end of Lake Paranoá , separated from the inner city , is a peninsula with many fashionable homes , and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore . Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake , but during early development private clubs , hotels , and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water . Set well apart from the city are satellite cities , including Gama , Ceilândia , Taguatinga , Núcleo Bandeirante , Sobradinho , and Planaltina . These cities , with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned .
In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced : some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred . Others complied . Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian , but powerful and influential ; and some provincial authorities were lenient , notably the Caesar in Gaul , Constantius Chlorus , the father of Constantine I. Diocletian 's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311 , when he asked Christians to pray for him . " This meant an ofﬁcial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire , although one of the tetrarchs , Maximinus Daia , still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313 . "
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
Eric P. Hamp in his 2012 Indo-European family tree , groups the Armenian language along with Greek and Ancient Macedonian ( " Helleno-Macedonian " ) in the Pontic Indo-European ( also called Helleno-Armenian ) subgroup . In Hamp 's view the homeland of this subgroup is the northeast coast of the Black Sea and its hinterlands . He assumes that they migrated from there southeast through the Caucasus with the Armenians remaining after Batumi while the pre-Greeks proceeded westwards along the southern coast of the Black Sea .
The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens , that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama , Vice President Biden , White House staff , and several cabinet secretaries . Similarly , in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd 's video " My story : Struggling , bullying , suicide , self-harm " , legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
In 1758 , the general of the Hindu Maratha Empire , Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Attock . Timur Shah Durrani , the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali , was driven out of Punjab . Lahore , Multan , Dera Ghazi Khan , Kashmir and other subahs on the south and eastern side of Peshawar were under the Maratha rule for the most part . In Punjab and Kashmir , the Marathas were now major players . The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 1761 , Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded the Maratha territory of Punjab and captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and re-consolidated control over them .
Jefferson and James Madison 's conceptions of separation have long been debated . Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency , though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia . Madison issued four religious proclamations while President , but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment . On the other hand , both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol . Years before the ratification of the Constitution , Madison contended " Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large , still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body . " After retiring from the presidency , Madison wrote of " total separation of the church from the state . " " " Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States , " Madison wrote , and he declared , " practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . " In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded , " We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts . do better without Kings & Nobles than with them . The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Govt . " Madison 's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States , as well as the Federal Government , from an establishment of religion , but the House did not pass them .

The first amendment to the US Constitution states " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " The two parts , known as the " establishment clause " and the " free exercise clause " respectively , form the textual basis for the Supreme Court 's interpretations of the " separation of church and state " doctrine . Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America 's doctrine for church-state separation : no coercion in religious matters , no expectation to support a religion against one 's will , and religious liberty encompasses all religions . In sum , citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith , any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary , and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world , Armenians ( especially in the diaspora ) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations . These include the Armenian Catholic Church ( which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the Roman Catholic Pope ) , the Armenian Evangelical Church , which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away , and the Armenian Brotherhood Church , which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church , but later broke apart from it . There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds .
The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily . The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina . The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor . Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma . The period was a time of great tectonic activity , as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together . The continent Euramerica ( or Laurussia ) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica , which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn . In these near-deserts , the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed , made red by the oxidized iron ( hematite ) characteristic of drought conditions . Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe , further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana . The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere . Sea levels were high worldwide , and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas . The deep , enormous Panthalassa ( the " universal ocean " ) covered the rest of the planet . Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys , Proto-Tethys , Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean ( which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica ) .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003–04 . This fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . In view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in Kathmandu are mainly by road and air . Kathmandu is connected by the Tribhuvan Highway to the south , Prithvi Highway to the west and Araniko Highway to the north . The BP Highway , connecting Kathmandu to the eastern part of Nepal is under construction .
The ad fontes principle also had many applications . The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism , and Neoplatonism , whose Pagan wisdom the humanists , like the Church fathers of old , tended , at least initially , to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue . The line from a drama of Terence , Homo sum , humani nihil a me alienum puto ( or with nil for nihil ) , meaning " I am a human being , I think nothing human alien to me " , known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine , gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude . The statement , in a play modeled or borrowed from a ( now lost ) Greek comedy by Menander , may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man 's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning , by Cicero and Saint Augustine , to name a few , and most notably by Seneca . Richard Bauman writes :
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian . However , the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon , and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city . Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places . Buff ( meat of water buffalo ) is very common . There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu , especially among Newars , which is not found in other parts of Nepal . Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago . Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal , pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes . A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo . The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow 's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity . The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly Momo or Chowmein .
In 1999 , the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification , apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation , although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement . This is understandable , since there is no compelling authority within them . On 18 July 2006 , delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration .
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
Eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army 's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy . He was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast . His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System . Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956 .
East of the Bronx River , the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas , or 'necks , ' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh : Hunts Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck ( Castle Hill Point ) and Throgs Neck . The East Bronx has older tenement buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multifamily homes , as well as single family homes . It includes New York City 's largest park : Pelham Bay Park along the Westchester-Bronx border .
^Note 2 : in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows : " Article IV . Section 10 . No person within this state shall , upon any pretense , be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience , nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rate , for the building or repairing any place of worship , or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry , contrary to what he believes to be right , or hath voluntarily engaged to do . No one religious society shall ever be established in this state , in preference to another ; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles . "
Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection . Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection . There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body . Some viruses once acquired never leave the body . A typical example is the herpes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
Episcopalians and Presbyterians , as well as other WASPs , tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated ( having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita ) than most other religious groups in United States , and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business , law and politics , especially the Republican Party . Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors , Rockefeller , Du Pont , Roosevelt , Forbes , Whitneys , the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world . Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music . In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called " kef " style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular . This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated . Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional " kef " style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of " kef music " heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time . Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia . Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry . Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan . Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent . In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . Practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . In 2003 , Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship , one of the categories of free flying . In August 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship .
In the 1960 election to choose his successor , Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President , Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy . He told friends , " I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy . " He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days , although he may have done Nixon some harm . When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , Eisenhower joked , " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " Kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy . Eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as Kennedy was 43 .
In November 2008 , 720p HD support was added . At the time of the 720p launch , the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9 . With this new feature , YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format . In November 2009 , 1080p HD support was added . In July 2010 , YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format , which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels . In June 2015 , support for 8K resolution was added , with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels .
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style , free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space . Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .

When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science ( see the history of science in the Renaissance ) . This was despite what A. C. Crombie ( viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress ) calls " a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity " , in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world . But Renaissance humanists , who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity , had no interest in scientific innovation . However , by the mid-to-late 16th century , even the universities , though still dominated by Scholasticism , began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology , thus setting the stage for Galileo 's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan ( 1906–1955 ) . It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings , letters and papers , memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members . The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to king Mahendra of Nepal ( 1920–1972 ) . Like the Tribhuvan Museum , it includes his personal belongings such as decorations , stamps , coins and personal notes and manuscripts , but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber . The Hanumandhoka Palace , a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar , contains three separate museums of historic importance . These museums include the Birendra museum , which contains items related to the second-last monarch , Birendra of Nepal .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it . They sought to create a citizenry ( frequently including women ) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions . This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis , today known as the humanities : grammar , rhetoric , history , poetry and moral philosophy . As a program to revive the cultural – and particularly the literary – legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity , Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like Rabelais or Erasmus as is still sometimes popularly believed .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century , and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement ( 1140 ) . The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary , St John and the two patron saints , Cipriano and Cipriana . When the church was demolished in the 19th century , the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia . It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s .
In 1948 , Eisenhower became President of Columbia University , an Ivy League university in New York City . The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction . During that year Eisenhower 's memoir , Crusade in Europe , was published . Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs , and it was a major financial success as well . Eisenhower 's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer , but rather , marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences , and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $ 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate . This ruling saved Eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation , Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion . These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom . In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Latvia , Estonia and Hungary , it remains one of the most popular religions . Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements , there are only few Protestant adherents ; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs , restrictions during the Communist rule , and also the ongoing secularization . Over the last several decades , religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased . According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer , Protestants made up 12 % of the EU population . According to Pew Research Center , Protestants constituted nearly one fifth ( or 17.8 % ) of the continent 's Christian population in 2010 . Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15 % of all Europeans in 2009 , while Noll claims that less than 12 % of them lived in Europe in 2010 .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
Several countries have established their national churches , linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state . Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries ; Denmark ( including Greenland ) , the Faroe Islands ( its church being independent since 2007 ) , Iceland and Norway have established Evangelical Lutheran churches . Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world , while Tonga—in the Methodist tradition . The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England , and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors : the Central Sector , the East Sector , the North Sector , the City Core and the West Sector . For civic administration , the city is further divided into 35 administrative wards . The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members . It holds biannual meetings to review , process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions . The ward 's profile documents for the 35 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population , the structure and condition of houses , the type of roads , educational , health and financial institutions , entertainment facilities , parking space , security provisions , etc . It also includes lists of development projects completed , on-going and planned , along with informative data about the cultural heritage , festivals , historical sites and the local inhabitants . Ward 16 is the largest , with an area of 437.4 ha ; ward 26 is the smallest , with an area of 4 ha .
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians ; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic , and the proprietors of Perth Amboy , New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers . The Province of West Jersey had declared , in 1681 , that there should be no religious test for office . An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope , which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution . That law was replaced by 1799 .
Educational attainment : In 2000 , according to the U.S. Census , out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old , 62.3 % had graduated from high school and 14.6 % held a bachelor 's or higher college degree . These percentages were lower than those for New York 's other boroughs , which ranged from 68.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 82.6 % ( Staten Island ) for high school graduates over 24 , and from 21.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 49.4 % ( Manhattan ) for college graduates . ( The respective state and national percentages were [ NY ] 79.1 % & 27.4 % and [ US ] 80.4 % & 24.4 % . )
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
A central teaching of Jehovah 's Witnesses is that the current world era , or " system of things " , entered the " last days " in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ , leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably . They consider all other present-day religions to be false , identifying them with " Babylon the Great " , or the " harlot " , of Revelation 17 , and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations , which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17 . This development will mark the beginning of the " great tribulation " . Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah 's Witnesses , an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon , during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ 's " sheep " , or true followers , will be destroyed . After Armageddon , God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth , which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden . After Armageddon , most of those who had died before God 's intervention will gradually be resurrected during " judgment day " lasting for one thousand years . This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds . At the end of the thousand years , Christ will hand all authority back to God . Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind . Those who fail will be destroyed , along with Satan and his demons . The end result will be a fully tested , glorified human race .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
On the other hand , in his study on nine of " the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world " , Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn , Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University , wrote : “The NW [ New World Translation ] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators , BeDuhn stated : “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal , conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament " violate [ s ] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God " .

Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube , and concluded that while the system was " surprisingly resilient " in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos , it was not infallible . The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases , as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use . If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID , it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision . YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site 's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length .
The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily . The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina . The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor . Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos .
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . Some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia , and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber . Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the Bona Dea rites .
The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza . In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus , identified by his name in Hebrew letters . Near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . The floor was paved in 508/509 . It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon ( Menois ) and the Christian church at Shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice ( mainly from the 17th–19th centuries , but the oldest one from 1270–75 , " The burial of St Mark in the first basilica " ) , the Cathedral of Orvieto ( golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century , many times redone ) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca ( huge , striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below , designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century ) . The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the Blessing Christ ( signed by one Solsternus from 1207 ) .
Praça dos Três Poderes ( Portuguese for Square of the Three Powers ) is a plaza in Brasília . The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza : the Executive , represented by the Palácio do Planalto ( presidential office ) ; the Legislative , represented by the National Congress ( Congresso Nacional ) ; and the Judicial branch , represented by the Supreme Federal Court ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) . It is a tourist attraction in Brasília , designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously .
In January 2010 , YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard . This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed . The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial . Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the H.264 or WebM formats could play the videos , and not all videos on the site were available .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
During the French Revolution , and soon after , in Germany ( by the Left Hegelians ) , humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind , without attention to the transcendent or supernatural . The designation Religious Humanism refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . It is similar to Protestantism , although centered on human needs , interests , and abilities rather than the supernatural . In the Anglophone world , such modern , organized forms of humanism , which are rooted in the 18th-century Enlightenment , have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts .
There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level . In 1773 , Isaac Backus , a prominent Baptist minister in New England , wrote against a state sanctioned religion , saying : " Now who can hear Christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? " He also observed that when " church and state are separate , the effects are happy , and they do not at all interfere with each other : but where they have been confounded together , no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued . " Thomas Jefferson 's influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786 , five years before the Bill of Rights .
The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma . Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia . The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow . Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high . Laurentia , Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia . Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole . Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere , and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean , Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean .
The Abbot of Monte Cassino , Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church . According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse , the arch and the vestibule of the basilica . Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds ( now in the Monte Cassino Museum ) . " The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts " – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .

Until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the German university model had spread around the world . Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . In Britain , the move from Industrial Revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray ( chairman of the University Grants Committee ) and Sir Samuel Curran , with the formation of the University of Strathclyde . The British also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in Europe .
Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination . More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient . Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype . Other techniques ( such as X-rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent . The images are useful in detection of , for example , a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion .
Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis , Washington . In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce . In June 1941 , he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger , Commander of the 3rd Army , at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3 , 1941 . Although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .

An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope , which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution . That law was replaced by 1799 .
Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that " Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making . " Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles . They were diverse in style , rich in color and ornamental motifs , and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them , such as artsvagorgs ( eagle-carpets ) , vishapagorgs ( dragon-carpets ) and otsagorgs ( serpent-carpets ) . The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches , " covered with vegatative ornaments " , and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
According to Der Spiegel , credits given to European governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives . A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that " The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " In previous years , Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank . " These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines . In May 2010 , the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and Great Britain third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP during 2010 .
The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet , stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible , and that it has not claimed its predictions were " the words of Jehovah . " George D. Chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 , 1925 and 1975 , the changing views and dates of the Jehovah 's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions . Chryssides further states , " it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the Witnesses as a group that continues to set a single end-date that fails and then devise a new one , as many counter-cultists do . " However , sociologist Andrew Holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago , " Witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time . "
In the general election , against the advice of his advisors , Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South , refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party . The campaign strategy , dubbed " K1C2 " , was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues : Korea , Communism and corruption . In an effort to accommodate the right , he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only ; he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed . The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium ( often adhesive-backed paper , sticky plastic or soft lime or putty ) as it will appear when installed . When the mosaic is complete , a similar medium is placed atop it . The piece is then turned over , the original underlying material is carefully removed , and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above . In comparison to the indirect method , this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator , to avoid damaging the work . Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work , which is important e.g . when the human figure is involved . This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use ( patent n. 0000222556 ) under the name of his company , Sicis International Srl , now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl .
In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede , Santa Maria in Domnica , Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura , Santa Cecilia in Trastevere , Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano . The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics . They were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . Another great work of Pope Leo , the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna , depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side , and SS . Susanna and Felicity on the other . It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . Pope Paschal I ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
Some legal scholars , such as John Baker of LSU , theorize that Madison 's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " —was rejected by the House , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists . To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown . During the debate over the establishment clause , Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison 's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
After the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite in 1957 , Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA , which led to the space race . During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Eisenhower condemned the Israeli , British and French invasion of Egypt , and forced them to withdraw . He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action . In 1958 , Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution . Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident . In his January 17 , 1961 farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending , particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers , and coined the term " military–industrial complex " .
The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) .
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite Bronx High School of Science , Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music , DeWitt Clinton High School , High School for Violin and Dance , Bronx Leadership Academy 2 , Bronx International High School , the School for Excellence , the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study , Wings Academy for young adults , The Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice , Validus Preparatory Academy , The Eagle Academy For Young Men , Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School , Bronx Academy of Letters , Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School of American Studies . The Bronx is also home to three of New York City 's most prestigious private , secular schools : Fieldston , Horace Mann , and Riverdale Country School .

Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
On November 6 , 2013 , Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented . The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments . They give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . In response , YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question " why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island , Chase Melvin noted that " Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who do n't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system " . In the same article Melvin goes on to say :
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean . In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean , the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the Proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . Roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , 600–540 Ma .
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen system , with two distinct seasons : the rainy season , from October to April , and a dry season , from May to September . The average temperature is 20.6 °C ( 69.1 °F ) . September , at the end of the dry season , has the highest average maximum temperature , 28.3 °C ( 82.9 °F ) , has major and minor lower maximum average temperature , of 25.1 °C ( 77.2 °F ) and 12.9 °C ( 55.2 °F ) , respectively . Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C ( 72 °F ) . With 247.4 mm ( 9.7 in ) , January is the month with the highest rainfall of the year , while June is the lowest , with only 8.7 mm ( 0.3 in ) .
Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the drachma . After signing the Maastricht Treaty , Greece applied to join the eurozone . The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of GDP . Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . On 1 January 2001 , Greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . However , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002 . This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 March 2012 .
The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi ( which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan ) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country . Punjabi is the provincial language of Punjab . There is not a single district in the province where Punjabi language is mother-tongue of less than 89 % of population . The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level . Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes , clans ( Urdu : برادری‎ ) and communities . In Pakistani Punjab these tribes have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications . Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include Majhi ( Standard ) , Saraiki and Hindko . Saraiki is mostly spoken in south Punjab , and Pashto , spoken in some parts of north west Punjab , especially in Attock District and Mianwali District .
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris , where student members are controlled by faculty " masters , " provided a standard for universities , the application of this model took at least three different forms . There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum ; this model tended to train specialists . There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature . There were also universities that combined these models , using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization .
In Miranda the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest . The court held that " The prosecution may not use statements , whether exculpatory or inculpatory , stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way , unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment 's privilege against self-incrimination "
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . An example is the Academy of European Law , which offers training in European law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . EUCLID ( Pôle Universitaire Euclide , Euclid University ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations , its peoples and member states . The European University Institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the European Union .
Jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1879 ) the Court wrote that Jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ First ] Amendment . " In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , Justice Hugo Black wrote : " In the words of Thomas Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state . "
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud 's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner 's Behaviorism . The approach emphasizes an individual 's inherent drive towards self-actualization and creativity . Psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow introduced a positive , humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s . Other sources include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology .
Devise Minority Party Strategies . The minority leader , in consultation with other party colleagues , has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives . The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances , such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party . For instance , a majority party riven by internal dissension , as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and " regular " Republicans were at loggerheads , may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion . Among the variable strategies available to the minority party , which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process , are the following :
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
As a consequence of his heart attack , Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm , which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25 , 1957 . This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand . The stroke had caused an aphasia . The president also suffered from Crohn 's disease , chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine , which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9 , 1956 . To treat the intestinal block , surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine . His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis . Eisenhower 's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits , but he still indulged in alcohol . During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29 , 1959 ; however , before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower " drank several gin-and-tonics , and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner " .
The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85 . The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . They were laid down in the Umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada . Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization , more than 4000 years ago . The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa . The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation . The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River . This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan . Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found . Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas , Achaemenids , Macedonians , Mauryas , Kushans , Guptas , and Hindu Shahi . It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time , otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire . Agriculture flourished and trading cities ( such as Multan and Lahore ) grew in wealth .
Greece was accused of trying to cover up the extent of its massive budget deficit in the wake of the global financial crisis . The allegation was prompted by the massive revision of the 2009 budget deficit forecast by the new PASOK government elected in October 2009 , from " 6–8 % " ( estimated by the previous New Democracy government ) to 12.7 % ( later revised to 15.7 % ) . However , the accuracy of the revised figures has also been questioned , and in February 2012 the Hellenic Parliament voted in favor of an official investigation following accusations by a former member of the Hellenic Statistical Authority that the deficit had been artificially inflated in order to justify harsher austerity measures .
The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party , and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader . Unlike the Majority Leader , the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress . If the Minority Leader 's party takes control of the House , and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats , the Minority Leader is usually the party 's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress , while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader . The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues .
Romulus was credited with several religious institutions . He founded the Consualia festival , inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate ; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus 's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome 's myth of origins . As a successful general , Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome 's first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the spolia opima , the prime spoils taken in war , in the celebration of the first Roman triumph . Spared a mortal 's death , Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified .
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County , one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York . The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers , Eastchester , and Pelham . In 1846 , a new town , West Farms , was created by division of Westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of Morrisania was created from West Farms . In 1873 , the town of Kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge , Riverdale , and Woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of Yonkers .
Valerian 's first religious edict singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult , outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome 's traditional gods . His second edict acknowledged a Christian threat to the Imperial system – not yet at its heart but close to it , among Rome’s equites and Senators . Christian apologists interpreted his disgraceful capture and death as divine judgement . The next forty years were peaceful ; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile , due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence . Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius ' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a “pagan” basis in Christian heresies . The Christian churches were disunited ; Paul of Samosata , Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 for " dogmatic reasons – his doctrine on the human nature of Christ was rejected – and for his lifestyle , which reminded his brethren of the habits of the administrative elite " . The reasons for his deposition were widely circulated among the churches . Meanwhile , Aurelian ( 270-75 ) appealed for harmony among his soldiers ( concordia militum ) , stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official , Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome 's Campus Martius .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that " Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making . " Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles . They were diverse in style , rich in color and ornamental motifs , and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them , such as artsvagorgs ( eagle-carpets ) , vishapagorgs ( dragon-carpets ) and otsagorgs ( serpent-carpets ) . The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches , " covered with vegatative ornaments " , and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh .
From an institutional perspective , the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader . For example , Rule XII , clause 6 , grant the minority leader ( or his designee ) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions ; Rule II , clause 6 , states the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker , majority leader , and minority leader ; and Rule XV , clause 6 , provides that the Speaker , after consultation with the minority leader , may place legislation on the Corrections Calendar . The minority leader also has other institutional duties , such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
In many ways , the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period . During the Paleocene , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents . Europe and Greenland were still connected . North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge , while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate . The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west , which ended in the succeeding epoch . South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas ( they joined during the Neogene ) ; the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart , with Africa , South America , Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other . Africa was heading north toward Europe , slowly closing the Tethys Ocean , and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas .
House minority leaders also hold joint news conferences and consult with their counterparts in the Senate—and with the president if their party controls the White House . The overall objectives are to develop a coordinated communications strategy , to share ideas and information , and to present a united front on issues . Minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the House ; they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country ; and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements . They must also be prepared " to debate on the floor , ad lib , no notes , on a moment 's notice , " remarked Minority Leader Michel . In brief , minority leaders are key strategists in developing and promoting the party 's agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the opposition 's arguments and proposals .
Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous animistic practices of Nepal . It is practiced by Kirat people . Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs , such as ancestor worship ( worship of Ajima ) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin . Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats , such as Pashupatinath , Wanga Akash Bhairabh ( Yalambar ) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu . Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice Mundhum in the city .
In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war . Believing that a general should not participate in politics , one author later wrote that " figuratively speaking , [ Eisenhower ] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office " . As others asked him about his political future , Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job " from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe " , and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions . In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired , the president would help the general win the 1948 election , and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower 's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination .
At about the same time , the word " humanism " as a philosophy centred on humankind ( as opposed to institutionalised religion ) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians , Arnold Ruge , and Karl Marx , who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government . There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms : philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history ; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists .
The Licchavis from the Indo-Gangetic plain migrated north and defeated the Kiratas , establishing the Licchavi dynasty . During this era , following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka , the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas . From Sankhu , they migrated to Yambu and Yengal ( Lanjagwal and Manjupattan ) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu . This created the basis of Newar Buddhism , which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world . With their migration , Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram during most of the Licchavi era .
Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah’s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . In 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
In November 2008 , 720p HD support was added . At the time of the 720p launch , the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9 . With this new feature , YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format . In November 2009 , 1080p HD support was added . In July 2010 , YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format , which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels . In June 2015 , support for 8K resolution was added , with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels .
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to Republic and to Empire . Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . In the early Republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia . The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . Plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . In principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . In reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond .
IMF 's forecast said that Greece 's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014 . But in fact , the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployemnt . The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009 , and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013 . In 2015 , Greece 's jobless rate is around 24 per cent . It is thought that Greece 's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier . Traditionally , these festivals were celebrated by Newars . In recent years , these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well . As the capital of the Republic of Nepal , various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu . With mass migration to the city , the cultures of Khas from the west , Kirats from the east , Bon/Tibetan from the north , and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously . The festivities such as the Ghode ( horse ) Jatra , Indra Jatra , Dashain Durga Puja festivals , Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm . Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics . These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings , as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion .
The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi ( which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan ) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country . Punjabi is the provincial language of Punjab . There is not a single district in the province where Punjabi language is mother-tongue of less than 89 % of population . The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level . Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes , clans ( Urdu : برادری‎ ) and communities . In Pakistani Punjab these tribes have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications . Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include Majhi ( Standard ) , Saraiki and Hindko . Saraiki is mostly spoken in south Punjab , and Pashto , spoken in some parts of north west Punjab , especially in Attock District and Mianwali District .
Over New York City in 1953 , Eastern Airlines Flight 8610 , a commercial flight , had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610 , a Lockheed C-121 Constellation known as Columbine II , while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower . This prompted the adoption of the unique call sign Air Force One , to be used whenever the president is on board any US Air Force aircraft . Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display .
In November 1945 , Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army . His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . However , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets , Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon . Indeed , Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese , writing , " First , the Japanese were ready to surrender and it was n't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . Second , I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " Initially , Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets . He even visited Warsaw in 1945 . Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . However , by mid-1947 , as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated , Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion .
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint , Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation . Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . A variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : In fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names God knows . This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience .
The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism , but in 380 under Theodosius I , Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire . Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus ( d. 402 ) were rejected . Christianity became increasingly popular . Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution , but Rome 's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms , and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur . The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space , and only later referred to a building . Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space ; its ancient boundary ( pomerium ) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough ; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state . In Rome , the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra ( Sacred Way ) and the pomerium . Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur , who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before , during and after an act of sacrifice . Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice , errant rites ( vitium ) or an unacceptable plan of action . If an unfavourable sign was given , the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen , consult with his augural colleagues , or abandon the project . Magistrates could use their right of augury ( ius augurum ) to adjourn and overturn the process of law , but were obliged to base their decision on the augur 's observations and advice . For Cicero , himself an augur , this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic . By his time ( mid 1st century BC ) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices , whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . The agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping . With 18 million international tourists in 2013 , Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world . The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world , with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
During the Early Modern period ( approximately late 15th century to 1800 ) , the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth , productivity and innovative research . At the end of the Middle Ages , about 400 years after the first university was founded , there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe . In the 15th century , twenty-eight new ones were created , with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625 . This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe , with the highest concentrations in the German Empire ( 34 ) , Italian countries ( 26 ) , France ( 25 ) , and Spain ( 23 ) – this was close to a 500 % increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages . This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared , or institutions that merged with other universities during this time . It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period , as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions . In fact , the term " university " was not always used to designate a higher education institution . In Mediterranean countries , the term studium generale was still often used , while " Academy " was common in Northern European countries .
The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society . In the middle Republican era , even Scipio 's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter 's special protege sat ill with his colleagues . Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal ; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus . Julius Caesar went further , and claimed her as his ancestress . Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired ; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation . In 63 BC , Julius Caesar 's appointment as pontifex maximus " signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics " . Likewise , political candidates could sponsor temples , priesthoods and the immensely popular , spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic . Under the principate , such opportunities were limited by law ; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ( " first citizen " ) .
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
President Truman , symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president , again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat . It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans . A " Draft Eisenhower " movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft . The effort was a long struggle ; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate , and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President . Henry Cabot Lodge , who served as his campaign manager , and others succeeded in convincing him , and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time . Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination , having won critical delegate votes from Texas . Eisenhower 's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan , " I Like Ike " . It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt 's policy at Yalta and against Truman 's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated . In defeating Taft for the nomination , it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party ; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose . Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike 's more advanced age .
Minority leaders may engage in numerous activities to publicize their party 's priorities and to criticize the opposition 's . For instance , to keep their party colleagues " on message , " they insure that partisan colleagues are sent packets of suggested press releases or " talking points " for constituent meetings in their districts ; they help to organize " town meetings " in Members ' districts around the country to publicize the party 's agenda or a specific priority , such as health care or education ; they sponsor party " retreats " to discuss issues and assess the party 's public image ; they create " theme teams " to craft party messages that might be raised during the one-minute , morning hour , or special order period in the House ; they conduct surveys of party colleagues to discern their policy preferences ; they establish websites that highlight and distribute party images and issues to users ; and they organize task forces or issue teams to formulate party programs and to develop strategies for communicating these programs to the public .

As of June 2012 [ update ] , Pakistan 's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab . According to protesters , load shedding was depriving the cities of electricity 20–22 hours a day , causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard . Gujranwala , Toba Tek Singh , Faisalabad , Sialkot , Bahawalnagar and communities across Khanewal District saw widespread rioting and violence on Sunday 17 June 2012 , with the houses of several members of parliament being attacked as well as the offices of regional energy suppliers Fesco , Gepco and Mepco being ransacked or attacked .
The city 's planned design included specific areas for almost everything , including accommodation , Hotels Sectors North and South . New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere , such as the hotels and tourism Sector North , located on the shores of Lake Paranoá . Brasília has a range of tourist accommodation from inns , pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels . The city 's restaurants cater to a wide range of foods from local and regional Brazilian dishes to international cuisine .
Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the drachma . After signing the Maastricht Treaty , Greece applied to join the eurozone . The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of GDP . Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . On 1 January 2001 , Greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . However , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002 . This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 March 2012 .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
Once the coastal assault had succeeded , Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy , and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany . Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group 's attack being made in the north , while Generals Bradley ( 12th U.S. Army Group ) and Devers ( Sixth U.S. Army Group ) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front ( respectively ) . Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces , often by giving them tactical , though sometimes ineffective , latitude ; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe . However , due to Eisenhower 's persistence , the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully , albeit belatedly , opened in late 1944 , and victory became a more distinct probability .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .

As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world , their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them , since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability . One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage , building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion . Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities , including dedications made by Romans to local gods . By the height of the Empire , numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces , among them Cybele , Isis , Epona , and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus , found as far north as Roman Britain . Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only , religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems . The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions , but sometimes to intractable conflict . For example , religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt .

From 1932 , it was taught that the " little flock " of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon . Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144,000 " anointed " who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ , a separate class of members , the " great multitude , " would live in a paradise restored on earth ; from 1935 , new converts to the movement were considered part of that class . By the mid-1930s , the timing of the beginning of Christ 's presence ( Greek : parousía ) , his enthronement as king , and the start of the " last days " were each moved to 1914 .
Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah’s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
Starting in the 1970s , the Bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " The Bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film . The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series , when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers . Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire . As the fire was captured on live television , announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " There it is , ladies and gentlemen : the Bronx is burning " . Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body , grows and multiplies . This is referred to as colonization . Most humans are not easily infected . Those who are weak , sick , malnourished , have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections . Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections . Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface , generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity , nose , eyes , genitalia , anus , or the microbe can enter through open wounds . While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry , many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs . Some pathogens grow within the host cells ( intracellular ) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids .
In January 1917 , the Watch Tower Society 's legal representative , Joseph Franklin Rutherford , was elected as its next president . His election was disputed , and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
Rome had no separate priestly caste or class . The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices , officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes . Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation . In household cult , the paterfamilias functioned as priest , and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants . Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise . The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines ( the singular is flamen ) , attributed to king Numa : the major flamines , dedicated to Jupiter , Mars and Quirinus , were traditionally drawn from patrician families . Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity , whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some . Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity ; Jupiter 's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
The largest ethnic groups are Newar ( 29.6 % ) , Matwali ( 25.1 % Sunuwar , Gurung , Magars , Tamang etc . ) , Khas Brahmins ( 20.51 % ) and Chettris ( 18.5 % ) . Tamangs originating from surrounding hill districts can be seen in Kathmandu . More recently , other hill ethnic groups and Caste groups from Terai have come to represent a substantial proportion of the city 's population . The major languages are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa , while English is understood by many , particularly in the service industry . The major religions are Hinduism and Buddhism .
The minority leader has a number of formal and informal party responsibilities . Formally , the rules of each party specify certain roles and responsibilities for their leader . For example , under Democratic rules for the 106th Congress , the minority leader may call meetings of the Democratic Caucus . He or she is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ; names the members of the Democratic Leadership Council ; chairs the Policy Committee ; and heads the Steering Committee . Examples of other assignments are making " recommendations to the Speaker on all Democratic Members who shall serve as conferees " and nominating party members to the Committees on Rules and House Administration . Republican rules identify generally comparable functions for their top party leader .
After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna . The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century . Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo . The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest . The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549 . The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco , executed in 545–547 ( largely destroyed ; the remains in Berlin ) .
The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland . The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the west from Alpine , Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County , New Jersey ; the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest ; the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast ; and to the east , Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island . Directly north of the Bronx are ( from west to east ) the adjoining Westchester County communities of Yonkers , Mount Vernon , Pelham Manor and New Rochelle . ( There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough of Manhattan , over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek . Marble Hill 's postal ZIP code , telephonic Area Code and fire service , however , are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan . )
The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond . Terence , an African and a former slave , was well placed to preach the message of universalism , of the essential unity of the human race , that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks , but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality . The influence of Terence 's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated . Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call :
There are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos ( 1122–34 ) . The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name , Piroska shows . The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier ( from 1122 ) is similarly personal . The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty , the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed . The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent . There is only a " Communion of the Apostles " in the apse of the cathedral of Serres .
The enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu . " Narayanhity " comes from Narayana , a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu , and Hiti , meaning " water spout " ( Vishnu 's temple is located opposite the palace , and the water spout is located east of the main entrance to the precinct ) . Narayanhity was a new palace , in front of the old palace built in 1915 , and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary Pagoda . It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah , then heir apparent to the throne . The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads . The palace area covers ( 30 hectares ( 74 acres ) ) and is fully secured with gates on all sides . This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre . After the fall of the monarchy , it was converted to a museum .
In 1999 , the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification , apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation , although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement . This is understandable , since there is no compelling authority within them . On 18 July 2006 , delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration .
The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar , who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy ; he was murdered soon after . Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors , and offered similar cult to Caesar 's successor , Augustus , who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship ; it might prove fatal . By the end of his reign , Augustus had appropriated Rome 's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his " reformed " and thoroughly integrated system of government . Towards the end of his life , he cautiously allowed cult to his numen . By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed , first in the Eastern Provinces , then in the West . Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context ; bathhouses , shrines and temples to Roman and local deities , amphitheatres and festivals . In the early Imperial period , the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship .
Protestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation , today regarded as branches . Some of these movements have a common lineage , sometimes directly spawning individual denominations . Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations , this section discusses only the largest denominational families , or branches , widely considered to be a part of Protestantism . These are , in alphabetical order : Adventist , Anglican , Baptist , Calvinist ( Reformed ) , Lutheran , Methodist and Pentecostal . A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed .
From 1932 , it was taught that the " little flock " of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon .

By the mid-1930s , the timing of the beginning of Christ 's presence ( Greek : parousía ) , his enthronement as king , and the start of the " last days " were each moved to 1914 .
Since June 2007 , YouTube 's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products . This required YouTube 's content to be transcoded into Apple 's preferred video standard , H.264 , a process that took several months . YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV , iPod Touch and the iPhone . In July 2010 , the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 , avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls . The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform . In September 2012 , YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone , following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system . According to GlobalWebIndex , YouTube was used by 35 % of smartphone users between April and June 2013 , making it the third most used app .
In a video posted on July 21 , 2009 , YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos . The videos can be viewed in several different ways , including the common anaglyph ( cyan/red lens ) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect . The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows , columns or a checkerboard pattern , side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan , green/magenta or blue/yellow combination . In May 2011 , an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision .
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture . Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .
6th-century BCE pre-Socratic Greek philosophers Thales of Miletus and Xenophanes of Colophon were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition , thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists . Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe . These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm . Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens . Pericles , the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras . Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include Protagoras ( like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles ) , known for his famous dictum " man is the measure of all things " and Democritus , who proposed that matter was composed of atoms . Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers , principally Plato and Aristotle . The historian Thucydides , noted for his scientific and rational approach to history , is also much admired by later humanists . In the 3rd century BCE , Epicurus became known for his concise phrasing of the problem of evil , lack of belief in the afterlife , and human-centred approaches to achieving eudaimonia . He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .
The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( " all the sea " ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean . The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age ; in the U.S. , these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup . Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass , Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in Western Europe , where the Triassic was first studied . In North America , for example , marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west . Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments , such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
Despite the lack of a coastline , Punjab is the most industrialised province of Pakistan ; its manufacturing industries produce textiles , sports goods , heavy machinery , electrical appliances , surgical instruments , vehicles , auto parts , metals , sugar mill plants , aircraft , cement , agricultural machinery , bicycles and rickshaws , floor coverings , and processed foods . In 2003 , the province manufactured 90 % of the paper and paper boards , 71 % of the fertilizers , 69 % of the sugar and 40 % of the cement of Pakistan .
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading . Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children , and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline , usually from David . His mother , previously a member ( with David ) of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites , joined the International Bible Students Association , later known as Jehovah 's Witnesses . The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 , though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students . His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother , who felt that warfare was " rather wicked , " but she did not overrule him . While speaking of himself in 1948 , Eisenhower said he was " one of the most deeply religious men I know " though unattached to any " sect or organization " . He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953 .
A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . Their powers include the legitimized use of force . The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( crossreacting ) , or by vaccination . Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens . There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .
Yet another may have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related financial services ( such as mortgage loans or insurance policies ) offered in some areas of the Bronx — a process known as redlining . Others have suggested a " planned shrinkage " of municipal services , such as fire-fighting . There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable ( or more costly ) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings .
President Truman , symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president , again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat . It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans . A " Draft Eisenhower " movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft . The effort was a long struggle ; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate , and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President . Henry Cabot Lodge , who served as his campaign manager , and others succeeded in convincing him , and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time . Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination , having won critical delegate votes from Texas . Eisenhower 's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan , " I Like Ike " . It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt 's policy at Yalta and against Truman 's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated . In defeating Taft for the nomination , it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party ; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose . Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike 's more advanced age .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of first-century Christianity . Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body , which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture . The Governing Body does not issue any single , comprehensive " statement of faith " , but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society . Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation , in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose , and that such enlightenment or " new light " results from the application of reason and study , the guidance of the holy spirit , and direction from Jesus Christ and angels . The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern " deep truths " , which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions . The religion 's leadership , while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility , is said to provide " divine guidance " through its teachings described as " based on God 's Word thus ... not from men , but from Jehovah . "
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
During the Reformation , the term was hardly used outside of the German politics . The word evangelical ( German : evangelisch ) , which refers to the gospel , was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement . Nowadays , this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations , above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD . The German word evangelisch means Protestant , and is different from the German evangelikal , which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism . The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches , and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole . It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England , where Evangelicalism originated , and then was brought to the United States . The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German , and is different from English reformed ( German : reformiert ) , which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
During the later part of the Malla era , Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities : Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , and Kirtipur . These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal . These states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . Evidence of an influx of ideas from India , Tibet , China , Persia , and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla . Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g . Tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g . Haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g . Mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . Amarkosh , a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD , was also found . Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square , Patan Durbar Square , Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the former durbar of Kirtipur , Nyatapola , Kumbheshwar , the Krishna temple , and others .
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . In this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut .
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes . There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome . During the Roman Republic ( 509–27 BC ) , the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs . Priests married , raised families , and led politically active lives . Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul . The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order , thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny . The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods , especially Jupiter , who embodied just rule . As a result of the Punic Wars ( 264–146 BC ) , when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power , many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success .
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common , their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness , whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment , the nature of immortality , whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium , and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth . The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible , leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath . The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church 's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs ( 1980 and 2005 ) , which use Biblical references as justification .
Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion . Most important was " the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life , " which sought to confine religion to a private sphere . Further , the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants ( and most Jews ) , who opposed aid to religious schools , which were mostly Catholic at the time . After 1980 , however , anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants , and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed . While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state , much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position . As a consequence , strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths , even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics . [ citation needed ]
Punjab 's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan , the Jhelum , Chenab , Ravi , and Sutlej rivers . There are several mountainous regions , including the Sulaiman Mountains in the southwest part of the province , and Margalla Hills , Salt Range , and Pothohar Plateau in the north . Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment in Punjab ; wheat and cotton are the principal crops . Since independence , Punjab has become the seat of political and economic power ; it remains the most industrialised province of Pakistan . It counts for 39.2 % of large scale manufacturing and 70 % of small scale manufacturing in the country . Its capital Lahore is a major regional cultural , historical , and economic centre .
There are several major exceptions on tuition fees . In many European countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . Public universities in Nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . Denmark , Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . Citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília . The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras ( " superblocks " ) : groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools , retail stores , and open spaces . At the northern end of Lake Paranoá , separated from the inner city , is a peninsula with many fashionable homes , and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore . Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake , but during early development private clubs , hotels , and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water . Set well apart from the city are satellite cities , including Gama , Ceilândia , Taguatinga , Núcleo Bandeirante , Sobradinho , and Planaltina . These cities , with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned .
Steven Waldman notes that ; " The evangelicals provided the political muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson , not merely because they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep the spiritual and secular worlds apart . " " Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners , " writes the historian Frank Lambert in his book The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America . " New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state . "
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed . The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium ( often adhesive-backed paper , sticky plastic or soft lime or putty ) as it will appear when installed . When the mosaic is complete , a similar medium is placed atop it . The piece is then turned over , the original underlying material is carefully removed , and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above . In comparison to the indirect method , this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator , to avoid damaging the work . Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work , which is important e.g . when the human figure is involved . This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use ( patent n. 0000222556 ) under the name of his company , Sicis International Srl , now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl .
Between 1975 and 2009 , Olympic Airways ( known after 2003 as Olympic Airlines ) was the country’s state-owned flag carrier , but financial problems led to its privatization and relaunch as Olympic Air in 2009 . Both Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air have won awards for their services ; in 2009 and 2011 , Aegean Airlines was awarded the " Best regional airline in Europe " award by Skytrax , and also has two gold and one silver awards by the ERA , while Olympic Air holds one silver ERA award for " Airline of the Year " as well as a " Condé Nast Traveller 2011 Readers Choice Awards : Top Domestic Airline " award .
An exceptionally well preserved , carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany , the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390 . Because of its purely geometrical pattern , the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas , especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem . A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
From an institutional perspective , the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader . For example , Rule XII , clause 6 , grant the minority leader ( or his designee ) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions ; Rule II , clause 6 , states the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker , majority leader , and minority leader ; and Rule XV , clause 6 , provides that the Speaker , after consultation with the minority leader , may place legislation on the Corrections Calendar . The minority leader also has other institutional duties , such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities .
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
Many scholars ( including Makdisi ) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus , the Emirate of Sicily , and the Middle East ( during the Crusades ) . Other scholars see this argument as overstated . Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education , turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context .
The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building , as the supercontinent Pangea came together . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana , which collided with North America-Europe ( Laurussia ) along the present line of eastern North America . This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe , and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America ; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains . In the same time frame , much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains . There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys . Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean ( closed by the assembly of South and North America ) , the small , shallow Ural Ocean ( which was closed by the collision of Baltica , and Siberia continents , creating the Ural Mountains ) and Proto-Tethys Ocean .
Juscelino Kubitschek , President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961 , ordered the construction of Brasília , fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise . Building Brasília was part of Juscelino 's " fifty years of prosperity in five " plan . Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 , with 5550 people competing . Oscar Niemeyer , a close friend , was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer . Brasília was built in 41 months , from 1956 to April 21 , 1960 , when it was officially inaugurated .
Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . Ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . Witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins .
When the U.S. entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth , Kansas . In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers . His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps , where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army . He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command – at the site of " Pickett 's Charge " on the Gettysburg , Pennsylvania Civil War battleground . Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat , he displayed excellent organizational skills , as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers ' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel .
Between 1949 and the 1980s , telephone communications in Greece were a state monopoly by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization , better known by its acronym , OTE . Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s , OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe . Since 2011 , the company 's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40 % stake , while the Greek state continues to own 10 % of the company 's shares . OTE owns several subsidiaries across the Balkans , including Cosmote , Greece 's top mobile telecommunications provider , Cosmote Romania and Albanian Mobile Communications .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland . The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the west from Alpine , Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County , New Jersey ; the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest ; the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast ; and to the east , Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island . Directly north of the Bronx are ( from west to east ) the adjoining Westchester County communities of Yonkers , Mount Vernon , Pelham Manor and New Rochelle . ( There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough of Manhattan , over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek . Marble Hill 's postal ZIP code , telephonic Area Code and fire service , however , are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan . )
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate , Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea 's Hellenised elite . Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them . Early Italian synagogues have left few traces ; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period . Judaea 's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora ; in Rome , this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion . Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by Julius Caesar . By the Augustan era , the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews . In some periods under Roman rule , Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice , under certain conditions . Judaism was a superstitio to Cicero , but the Church Father Tertullian described it as religio licita ( an officially permitted religion ) in contrast to Christianity .
Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . A cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells . The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well . Two methods , the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease . The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria , both of which contain many significant human pathogens . The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia .
The capital and largest city is Lahore which was the historical capital of the wider Punjab region . Other important cities include Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Gujranwala , Sargodha , Multan , Sialkot , Bahawalpur , Gujrat , Sheikhupura , Jhelum and Sahiwal . Undivided Punjab is home to six rivers , of which five flow through Pakistani Punjab . From west to east , these are : the Indus , Jhelum , Beas , Chenab , Ravi and Sutlej . Nearly 60 % of Pakistan 's population lives in the Punjab . It is the nation 's only province that touches every other province ; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad . In the acronym P-A-K-I-S-T-A-N , the P is for Punjab .
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
Legendary Princess Bhrikuti ( 7th-century ) and artist Araniko ( 1245 - 1306 AD ) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China . There are over 108 traditional monasteries ( Bahals and Bahis ) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism . Since the 1960s , the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area . Also , with the modernization of Newar Buddhism , various Theravada Bihars have been established .
Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns . Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound , T. E. Hulme , and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental " slop " ( Hulme ) [ citation needed ] or " an old bitch gone in the teeth " ( Pound ) and wanted to go back to a more manly , authoritarian society such as ( they believed ) existed in the Middle Ages . Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists , such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault , have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature , which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human . " Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal " , suggests Timothy Laurie , turning the human into what he calls " a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans ( e.g . rationality , altruism ) , rather than most commonplace ( e.g . hunger , anger ) " . Nevertheless , philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals , anti-humanism thus frequently " secretes a humanist rhetoric " .
Divorce is discouraged , and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery , which they refer to as " a scriptural divorce " . If a divorce is obtained for any other reason , remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality . Extreme physical abuse , willful non-support of one 's family , and what the religion terms " absolute endangerment of spirituality " are considered grounds for legal separation .
House minority leaders also hold joint news conferences and consult with their counterparts in the Senate—and with the president if their party controls the White House . The overall objectives are to develop a coordinated communications strategy , to share ideas and information , and to present a united front on issues . Minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the House ; they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country ; and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements . They must also be prepared " to debate on the floor , ad lib , no notes , on a moment 's notice , " remarked Minority Leader Michel . In brief , minority leaders are key strategists in developing and promoting the party 's agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the opposition 's arguments and proposals .
Historically , the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient Armenia . The earliest attestations of the exonym Armenia date around the 6th century BC . In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC , Darius I the Great of Persia refers to Urashtu ( in Babylonian ) as Armina ( in Old Persian ; Armina ( ) and Harminuya ( in Elamite ) . In Greek , Αρμένιοι " Armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus ( 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians .
In the wake of religious riots in Egypt , the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to " ancestral gods " or suffer a penalty : only Jews were exempt . Decius ' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults ; no ancestral gods were specified by name . The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman . Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective ; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults , but apostasy was sought , rather than capital punishment . A year after its due deadline , the edict expired .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings , a far more prestigious artform , and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos . Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek , suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire ; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves . Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa , in places such as Carthage , and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis , Tunisia .
In November 2008 , 720p HD support was added . At the time of the 720p launch , the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9 . With this new feature , YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format . In November 2009 , 1080p HD support was added . In July 2010 , YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format , which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels . In June 2015 , support for 8K resolution was added , with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention . This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead , especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict ( Goldsmith and Sheptycki , 2007 ) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions ( Hills , 2009 ) .

Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
Despite its tropical wet and dry climate , extensive irrigation makes it a rich agricultural region . Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world . Wheat and cotton are the largest crops . Other crops include rice , sugarcane , millet , corn , oilseeds , pulses , vegetables , and fruits such as kinoo . Livestock and poultry production are also important . Despite past animosities , the rural masses in Punjab 's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting .
Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .

Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice ( mainly from the 17th–19th centuries , but the oldest one from 1270–75 , " The burial of St Mark in the first basilica " ) , the Cathedral of Orvieto ( golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century , many times redone ) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca ( huge , striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below , designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century ) . The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the Blessing Christ ( signed by one Solsternus from 1207 ) .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
In June 2007 , YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom , which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . The system , which became known as Content ID , creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . When a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( Ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian . Geologically , the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . Throughout the early Paleozoic , the Earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea , which included most of the Earth 's land area .
Eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army 's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy . He was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast . His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System . Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956 .
World literature was enriched by the works of Edmund Spenser , John Milton , John Bunyan , John Donne , John Dryden , Daniel Defoe , William Wordsworth , Jonathan Swift , Johann Wolfgang Goethe , Friedrich Schiller , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Edgar Allan Poe , Matthew Arnold , Conrad Ferdinand Meyer , Theodor Fontane , Washington Irving , Robert Browning , Emily Dickinson , Emily Brontë , Charles Dickens , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Thomas Stearns Eliot , John Galsworthy , Thomas Mann , William Faulkner , John Updike , and many others .
Over New York City in 1953 , Eastern Airlines Flight 8610 , a commercial flight , had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610 , a Lockheed C-121 Constellation known as Columbine II , while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower . This prompted the adoption of the unique call sign Air Force One , to be used whenever the president is on board any US Air Force aircraft . Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah 's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory . In 1933 , there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses in Germany , of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned . Of those , 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . In Canada , Jehovah 's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent . In the former Soviet Union , about 9,300 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951 . Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including China , Vietnam and some Islamic states .
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) , law , grammar and rhetoric . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum , while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship . The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs can not be underestimated . Once humanist professors joined the university faculty , they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction , to translate and interpret classical texts , and to live honorable lives . Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts , as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts . Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno , Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts . The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship . For instance , Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen , whose ideas he verified through his own dissections . In law , Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective , while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist . Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts , which was important for the reform at Protestant universities . Galileo Galilei , who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua , and Martin Luther , who taught at the University of Wittenberg ( as did Melanchthon ) , also had humanist training . The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university ; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs , syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship .
All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge , and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions . Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends . The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts .
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( Amendment XIV ) is one of the post-Civil War amendments , intended to secure rights for former slaves . It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others . The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states . While it has not been fully implemented , the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure , through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause , the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states .
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era . Rulers from Tirhut , upon being attacked by Muslims , fled north to the Kathmandu valley . They intermarried with Nepali royalty , and this led to the Malla era . The early years of the Malla era were turbulent , with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims . There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu 's population , including the king Abhaya Malla . These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era ( such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan ) , and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city . Despite the initial hardships , Kathmandu rose to prominence again and , during most of the Malla era , dominated the trade between India and Tibet . Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade .
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style , free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space . Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
They can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as Brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . A " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in South Africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
The 1981 film Fort Apache , The Bronx is another film that used the Bronx 's gritty image for its storyline . The movie 's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed " Fort Apache " . Also from 1981 is the horror film Wolfen making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures . Knights of the South Bronx , a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children , is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005 . The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film Fuga dal Bronx , also known as Bronx Warriors 2 and Escape 2000 , an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series Mystery Science Theatre 3000 . The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation 's plans to depopulate , destroy and redevelop the Bronx , and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation 's murderous ways and save their homes . The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase , " Leave the Bronx ! " Many of the movie 's scenes were filmed in Queens , substituting as the Bronx . Rumble in the Bronx was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film , another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences . Last Bronx , a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo , where crime and gang warfare is rampant .
A central teaching of Jehovah 's Witnesses is that the current world era , or " system of things " , entered the " last days " in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ , leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably . They consider all other present-day religions to be false , identifying them with " Babylon the Great " , or the " harlot " , of Revelation 17 , and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations , which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17 . This development will mark the beginning of the " great tribulation " . Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah 's Witnesses , an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon , during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ 's " sheep " , or true followers , will be destroyed . After Armageddon , God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth , which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden . After Armageddon , most of those who had died before God 's intervention will gradually be resurrected during " judgment day " lasting for one thousand years . This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds . At the end of the thousand years , Christ will hand all authority back to God . Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind . Those who fail will be destroyed , along with Satan and his demons . The end result will be a fully tested , glorified human race .
Several versions of a semi-official , structured pantheon were developed during the political , social and religious instability of the Late Republican era . Jupiter , the most powerful of all gods and " the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested " , consistently personified the divine authority of Rome 's highest offices , internal organization and external relations . During the archaic and early Republican eras , he shared his temple , some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus , who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva . A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres , Liber and Libera , and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult . Other major and minor deities could be single , coupled , or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure . These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic , part philosophical creations , and often Greek in origin . The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians , and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
In 1953 , the Republican Party 's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch ; however , the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point . At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower 's presidency .
After 1517 , when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available , the Dutch humanist Erasmus , who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius , began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla , comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter . Erasmus , along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples , began issuing new translations , laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Henceforth Renaissance humanism , particularly in the German North , became concerned with religion , while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists , studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith . After the Reformation , critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school .
Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection . Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection . There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body . Some viruses once acquired never leave the body . A typical example is the herpes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece’s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece’s Eurozone entry .
The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi ( which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan ) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country . Punjabi is the provincial language of Punjab . There is not a single district in the province where Punjabi language is mother-tongue of less than 89 % of population . The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level . Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes , clans ( Urdu : برادری‎ ) and communities . In Pakistani Punjab these tribes have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications . Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include Majhi ( Standard ) , Saraiki and Hindko . Saraiki is mostly spoken in south Punjab , and Pashto , spoken in some parts of north west Punjab , especially in Attock District and Mianwali District .
The view of the Roman Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations can not be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas , and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession . According to Bishop Hilarion ( Alfeyev ) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject .
The development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between New England and New York ( Manhattan ) . Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule . Kingsbridge , built in 1693 where Broadway reached the Spuyten Duyvil Creek , was a possession of Frederick Philipse , lord of Philipse Manor . The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek . In 1759 , the farmers led by Jacobus Dyckman and Benjamin Palmer built a " free bridge " across the Harlem River which led to the abandonment of tolls altogether .
In the original city plan , the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station . Because of the growth of Brasília ( and corresponding growth in the bus fleet ) , today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station ( called Rodoferroviária ) , located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental . The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station . A new bus station was opened in July 2010 . It is on Saída Sul ( South Exit ) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station , and it 's also an inter-state bus station , used only to leave the Federal District .
In many ways , the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period . During the Paleocene , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents . Europe and Greenland were still connected . North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge , while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate . The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west , which ended in the succeeding epoch . South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas ( they joined during the Neogene ) ; the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart , with Africa , South America , Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other . Africa was heading north toward Europe , slowly closing the Tethys Ocean , and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas .
Among the Punjabi poets , the names of Sultan Bahu , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Baksh , and Waris Shah and folk singers like Inayat Hussain Bhatti and Tufail Niazi , Alam Lohar , Sain Marna , Mansoor Malangi , Allah Ditta Lona wala , Talib Hussain Dard , Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi , Gamoo Tahliwala , Mamzoo Gha-lla , Akbar Jat , Arif Lohar , Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known . In the composition of classical ragas , there are such masters as Malika-i-Mauseequi ( Queen of Music ) Roshan Ara Begum , Ustad Amanat Ali Khan , Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan . Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature , by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979 .

The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , Armenia was an independent republic . In late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army , and in 1922 , Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union , later forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 1936 to September 21 , 1991 ) . In 1991 , Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia .
Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah’s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines .
Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman religio . The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons , the apparent shrinking of the sun 's disc , two moons in a daylit sky , a cosmic battle between sun and moon , a rain of red-hot stones , a bloody sweat on statues , and blood in fountains and on ears of corn : all were expiated by sacrifice of " greater victims " . The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural ; sheep become goats , a hen become a cock ( and vice versa ) – these were expiated with " lesser victims " . The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina , singing a hymn to avert disaster : a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation . Religious restitution is proved only by Rome 's victory .
As the election approached , other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president . In January 1948 , after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention , Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was " not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office " ; " life-long professional soldiers " , he wrote , " in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason , [ should ] abstain from seeking high political office " . Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time . Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president ; Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the other probable winner , would presumably serve two terms , and Eisenhower , at age 66 in 1956 , would then be too old .
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as : Bhavani , Durga , Gaja-Lakshmi , Hariti-Sitala , Mahsishamardini , Saptamatrika ( seven mother goddesses ) , and Sri-Lakshmi ( wealth-goddess ) . From the 3rd century BC , apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses , Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period ( it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC ) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular . These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution : the Licchavi or classical period ( 500 to 900 AD ) , the post-classical period ( 1000 to 1400 AD ) , with strong influence of the Palla art form ; the Malla period ( 1400 onwards ) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens , that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama , Vice President Biden , White House staff , and several cabinet secretaries . Similarly , in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd 's video " My story : Struggling , bullying , suicide , self-harm " , legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy .
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture . Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa , Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily . Once Mussolini , the Italian leader , had fallen in Italy , the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche . But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians , the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country – making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of Italy was highly successful .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion . Most important was " the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life , " which sought to confine religion to a private sphere . Further , the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants ( and most Jews ) , who opposed aid to religious schools , which were mostly Catholic at the time . After 1980 , however , anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants , and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed . While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state , much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position . As a consequence , strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths , even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics . [ citation needed ]
Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 . Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan 's nuclear program such as Kahuta . It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi . The peace process between India and Pakistan , which began in earnest in 2004 , has helped pacify the situation . Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common . Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib .
Once the coastal assault had succeeded , Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy , and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany . Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group 's attack being made in the north , while Generals Bradley ( 12th U.S. Army Group ) and Devers ( Sixth U.S. Army Group ) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front ( respectively ) . Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces , often by giving them tactical , though sometimes ineffective , latitude ; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe . However , due to Eisenhower 's persistence , the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully , albeit belatedly , opened in late 1944 , and victory became a more distinct probability .
Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
In June 2007 , YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom , which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . The system , which became known as Content ID , creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . When a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery , located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds , hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors , and regularly organizes exhibitions . It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art . Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery , located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house , giving an important insight into Nepali history . The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu , near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg , Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent , established Nepali painters . The Nepal Art Council Gallery , located in the Babar Mahal , on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions .
The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals . Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire : in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors . Ambrose , the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus 's request for tolerance . Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of Rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] He was the last emperor of both East and West .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
According to Eurostat , Greece 's largest port by tons of goods transported in 2010 is the port of Aghioi Theodoroi , with 17.38 million tons . The Port of Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons , followed by the Port of Piraeus , with 13.2 million tons , and the port of Eleusis , with 12.37 million tons . The total number of goods transported through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million tons , a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the country in 2007 . Since then , Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean 's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO . In 2013 , Piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
He assumed duties again at Camp Meade , Maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . His schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton , Sereno E. Brett , and other senior tank leaders . Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
Public priests were appointed by the collegia . Once elected , a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine , which offered him lifetime influence , privilege and immunity . Therefore , civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family . Religious law was collegial and traditional ; it informed political decisions , could overturn them , and was difficult to exploit for personal gain . Priesthood was a costly honour : in traditional Roman practice , a priest drew no stipend . Cult donations were the property of the deity , whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds . For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum , permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime 's service in military or political life , or preferably both : it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty . For a freedman or slave , promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile , and opportunities in local politics ; and therefore business . During the Imperial era , priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office ; in effect , it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum . In Rome , the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren , once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities , then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms . The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays , accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt . Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year , provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time .
In 1999 , the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification , apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation , although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement . This is understandable , since there is no compelling authority within them . On 18 July 2006 , delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration .
Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances . Some rituals specifically required the presence of women , but their active participation was limited . As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice , the central rite of most major public ceremonies . In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals , some cult practices were reserved for women only . The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely . Because women enter the public record less frequently than men , their religious practices are less known , and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias . A host of deities , however , are associated with motherhood . Juno , Diana , Lucina , and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of " separation of church and state " , or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment . Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution , while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified . These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers . Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts , and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence , which references the idea of a " Creator " and " Nature 's God " , though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a " Creator " or " Nature 's God . "
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479 , Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood ( Santa Hermandad ) as a national police force . They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves , and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases . The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835 .
Chthonic gods such as Dis pater , the di inferi ( " gods below " ) , and the collective shades of the departed ( di Manes ) were given dark , fertile victims in nighttime rituals . Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering , and there was no shared banquet , as " the living can not share a meal with the dead " . Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals ; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival . Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices . Demigods and heroes , who belonged to the heavens and the underworld , were sometimes given black-and-white victims . Robigo ( or Robigus ) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from God , and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements . They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed . Jehovah 's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " The Witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah 's approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan . Witnesses are taught that association with " worldly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality .
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been " fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution " , TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that " what Gutenberg did for writing , online video can now do for face-to-face communication " . Anderson asserted that it 's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance , and that video contributors may be about to launch " the biggest learning cycle in human history . " In education , for example , the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan 's cousin into what Forbes ' Michael Noer called " the largest school in the world " , with technology poised to disrupt how people learn .
During the late 1920s and early 1930s , Eisenhower 's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat , as military priorities diminished ; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs . He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing , and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower , then a journalist at the Agriculture Department , he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe . He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928 . After a one-year assignment in France , Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely , Assistant Secretary of War , from 1929 to February 1933 . Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Industrial College ( Washington , DC ) in 1933 and later served on the faculty ( it was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy ) .

As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world , their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them , since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability . One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage , building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion . Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities , including dedications made by Romans to local gods . By the height of the Empire , numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces , among them Cybele , Isis , Epona , and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus , found as far north as Roman Britain . Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only , religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems . The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions , but sometimes to intractable conflict . For example , religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt .
Divorce is discouraged , and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery , which they refer to as " a scriptural divorce " . If a divorce is obtained for any other reason , remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality . Extreme physical abuse , willful non-support of one 's family , and what the religion terms " absolute endangerment of spirituality " are considered grounds for legal separation .
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as : Bhavani , Durga , Gaja-Lakshmi , Hariti-Sitala , Mahsishamardini , Saptamatrika ( seven mother goddesses ) , and Sri-Lakshmi ( wealth-goddess ) . From the 3rd century BC , apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses , Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period ( it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC ) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular . These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution : the Licchavi or classical period ( 500 to 900 AD ) , the post-classical period ( 1000 to 1400 AD ) , with strong influence of the Palla art form ; the Malla period ( 1400 onwards ) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology .
The metro leaves the Rodoviária ( bus station ) and goes south , avoiding most of the political and tourist areas . The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities , such as Samambaia , Taguatinga and Ceilândia , as well as Guará and Águas Claras . The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself ( the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants , Taguatinga had 243,575 , whereas the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants ) , and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation .
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen system , with two distinct seasons : the rainy season , from October to April , and a dry season , from May to September . The average temperature is 20.6 °C ( 69.1 °F ) . September , at the end of the dry season , has the highest average maximum temperature , 28.3 °C ( 82.9 °F ) , has major and minor lower maximum average temperature , of 25.1 °C ( 77.2 °F ) and 12.9 °C ( 55.2 °F ) , respectively . Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C ( 72 °F ) . With 247.4 mm ( 9.7 in ) , January is the month with the highest rainfall of the year , while June is the lowest , with only 8.7 mm ( 0.3 in ) .
The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up , as Europe , Greenland and North America drifted apart . In western North America , mountain building started in the Eocene , and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts . In Europe , the Tethys Sea finally vanished , while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant , the Mediterranean , and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north . Though the North Atlantic was opening , a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia , creating the Himalayan orogeny .
At about the same time , the word " humanism " as a philosophy centred on humankind ( as opposed to institutionalised religion ) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians , Arnold Ruge , and Karl Marx , who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government . There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms : philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history ; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .
The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma . Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia . The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow . Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high . Laurentia , Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia . Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole . Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere , and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean , Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean .
Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris , where student members are controlled by faculty " masters , " provided a standard for universities , the application of this model took at least three different forms . There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum ; this model tended to train specialists . There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature . There were also universities that combined these models , using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization .
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of Butrint , Albania appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation . Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . A variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : In fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names God knows . This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience .
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
The Earth of the early Archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . During this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
J. Brent Walker , Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee , responded to Hamburger 's claims noting ; " The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle . Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture . Of course , separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools . But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry "
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
Several countries have established their national churches , linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state . Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries ; Denmark ( including Greenland ) , the Faroe Islands ( its church being independent since 2007 ) , Iceland and Norway have established Evangelical Lutheran churches . Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world , while Tonga—in the Methodist tradition . The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England , and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
The city has a unique status in Brazil , as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other cities in Brazil . The name 'Brasília ' is commonly used as a synonym for the Federal District through synecdoche ; However , the Federal District is composed of 31 administrative regions , only one of which is Brasília proper , with a population of 209,926 in a 2011 survey ; Demographic publications generally do not make this distinction and list the population of Brasília as synonymous with the population of the Federal District , considering the whole of it as its metropolitan area . The city was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Additionally , Brasília hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup .
As a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece 's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country 's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7 % in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) . In order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries , and the IMF , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling €110 billion . In order to secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control . Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .
During the Reformation , the term was hardly used outside of the German politics . The word evangelical ( German : evangelisch ) , which refers to the gospel , was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement . Nowadays , this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations , above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD . The German word evangelisch means Protestant , and is different from the German evangelikal , which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism . The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches , and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole . It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England , where Evangelicalism originated , and then was brought to the United States . The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German , and is different from English reformed ( German : reformiert ) , which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians .
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities , resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices . In one decade , the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001 . The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021 . To keep up this population growth , the KMC-controlled area of 5,076.6 hectares ( 12,545 acres ) has expanded to 8,214 hectares ( 20,300 acres ) in 2001 . With this new area , the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001 ; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021 .
Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 . Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan 's nuclear program such as Kahuta . It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi . The peace process between India and Pakistan , which began in earnest in 2004 , has helped pacify the situation . Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common . Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Jefferson and James Madison 's conceptions of separation have long been debated . Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency , though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia . Madison issued four religious proclamations while President , but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment . On the other hand , both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol . Years before the ratification of the Constitution , Madison contended " Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large , still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body . " After retiring from the presidency , Madison wrote of " total separation of the church from the state . " " " Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States , " Madison wrote , and he declared , " practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . " In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded , " We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts . do better without Kings & Nobles than with them . The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Govt . " Madison 's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States , as well as the Federal Government , from an establishment of religion , but the House did not pass them .

Jehovah 's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages . The objective is to start a regular " Bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " Field Service Report " . Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive " .
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . By 1992 , with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe ( Joubert and Bevers , 1996 ) .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
The clearance of the pathogens , either treatment-induced or spontaneous , it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients . For instance , for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b ( brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron ) combined with ribavirin , it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene , encoding interferon lambda 3 , are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus . This finding , originally reported in Nature , showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others . Later report from Nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus .
Religious humanism is an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that centre on human needs , interests , and abilities . Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of " humanism " until the late 19th and early 20th centuries , non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history . The Cult of Reason ( French : Culte de la Raison ) was a religion based on deism devised during the French Revolution by Jacques Hébert , Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters . In 1793 during the French Revolution , the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a " Temple to Reason " and for a time Lady Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars . In the 1850s , Auguste Comte , the Father of Sociology , founded Positivism , a " religion of humanity " . One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London . This early group was democratically organised , with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences , philosophy , and the arts . The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876 . The movement 's founder , Felix Adler , a former member of the Free Religious Association , conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions . Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people 's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern .
The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively shaped the Church of Scotland . The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines , and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France . John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation . The Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope 's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560 , forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith . It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise , who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter .
During Soviet rule , Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions . The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . In football , their most successful team was Yerevan 's FC Ararat , which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like FC Bayern Munich in the Euro cup .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
Raymond B. Bragg , the associate editor of The New Humanist , sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead , Charles Francis Potter , and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference . Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 . Potter 's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
Exhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage . The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions are held . It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots .
Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been " fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution " , TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that " what Gutenberg did for writing , online video can now do for face-to-face communication " . Anderson asserted that it 's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance , and that video contributors may be about to launch " the biggest learning cycle in human history . " In education , for example , the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan 's cousin into what Forbes ' Michael Noer called " the largest school in the world " , with technology poised to disrupt how people learn .
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . An example is the Academy of European Law , which offers training in European law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . EUCLID ( Pôle Universitaire Euclide , Euclid University ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations , its peoples and member states . The European University Institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the European Union .
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu , near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building . This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa . It is the most important museum in the country , housing an extensive collection of weapons , art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance . The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons , and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana , meaning " the stone house of arms and ammunition " . Given its focus , the museum contains many weapons , including locally made firearms used in wars , leather cannons from the 18th–19th century , and medieval and modern works in wood , bronze , stone and paintings .
Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence . Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement , since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators . This practice is controversial , with for example , New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers .
A party 's floor leader , in conjunction with other party leaders , plays an influential role in the formulation of party policy and programs . He is instrumental in guiding legislation favored by his party through the House , or in resisting those programs of the other party that are considered undesirable by his own party . He is instrumental in devising and implementing his party 's strategy on the floor with respect to promoting or opposing legislation . He is kept constantly informed as to the status of legislative business and as to the sentiment of his party respecting particular legislation under consideration . Such information is derived in part from the floor leader 's contacts with his party 's members serving on House committees , and with the members of the party 's whip organization .
Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is : in whose interest is it ? At a more practical level , the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable ( Sheptycki , 2004 ) . For example , according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 ( Lloyd , et al . 2007 ) Interpol had the lowest scores in its category ( IGOs ) , coming in tenth with a score of 22 % on overall accountability capabilities ( p. 19 ) . As this report points out , and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm , this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement .

The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva ( Pashupati ) . Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu , Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu . It served as the seat of national deity , Lord Pashupatinath , until Nepal was secularized . However , a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior . The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century , although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old . The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Shivaratri , or the night of Lord Shiva , is the most important festival that takes place here , attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus .

An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .
Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings , according to the principle do ut des ( " I give , that you might give " ) . Proper , respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity . Religious neglect was a form of atheism : impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia ( impious errors ) . Excessive devotion , fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio . Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger ( ira deorum ) and therefore harm the State . The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions , and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors . Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values .
In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the English language in this sense . The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when German historian and philologist Georg Voigt used humanism to describe Renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the Italian Renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially Italy .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
Provide Campaign Assistance . Minority leaders are typically energetic and aggressive campaigners for partisan incumbents and challengers . There is hardly any major aspect of campaigning that does not engage their attention . For example , they assist in recruiting qualified candidates ; they establish " leadership PACs " to raise and distribute funds to House candidates of their party ; they try to persuade partisan colleagues not to retire or run for other offices so as to hold down the number of open seats the party would need to defend ; they coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national party campaign committees ; they encourage outside groups to back their candidates ; they travel around the country to speak on behalf of party candidates ; and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant financial contributions to the party 's campaign committee . " The amount of time that [ Minority Leader ] Gephardt is putting in to help the DCCC [ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] is unheard of , " noted a Democratic lobbyist . " No DCCC chairman has ever had that kind of support . "
It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America . The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement , Nicolaus Zinzendorf , the Moravian Church , Lutheran pietism , Presbyterianism and Puritanism . Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Harold John Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones .
Instruments like the duduk , the dhol , the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music . Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music . One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia . Many of these chants are ancient in origin , extending to pre-Christian times , while others are relatively modern , including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots , the inventor of the Armenian alphabet . Whilst under Soviet rule , Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music , for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane .
In May 2007 , YouTube launched its Partner Program , a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site . YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program , with 55 percent going to the uploader . There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program . According to TubeMogul , in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube ( one that is shown before the video starts ) cost advertisers on average $ 7.60 per 1000 views . Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement , due to a lack of interested advertisers . Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos , a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $ 7.60 X 55 % = $ 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
Kathmandu Metropolitan City ( KMC ) , in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat ( IRC ) . KMC 's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene , Oregon , United States . This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities : Motsumoto City of Japan , Rochester of the USA , Yangon ( formerly Rangoon ) of Myanmar , Xi'an of the People 's Republic of China , Minsk of Belarus , and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea . KMC 's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries , other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu .
Public priests were appointed by the collegia . Once elected , a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine , which offered him lifetime influence , privilege and immunity . Therefore , civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family . Religious law was collegial and traditional ; it informed political decisions , could overturn them , and was difficult to exploit for personal gain . Priesthood was a costly honour : in traditional Roman practice , a priest drew no stipend . Cult donations were the property of the deity , whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds . For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum , permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime 's service in military or political life , or preferably both : it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty . For a freedman or slave , promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile , and opportunities in local politics ; and therefore business . During the Imperial era , priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office ; in effect , it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum . In Rome , the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren , once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities , then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms . The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays , accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt . Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year , provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time .
President Truman , symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president , again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat . It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans . A " Draft Eisenhower " movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft . The effort was a long struggle ; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate , and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President . Henry Cabot Lodge , who served as his campaign manager , and others succeeded in convincing him , and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time . Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination , having won critical delegate votes from Texas . Eisenhower 's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan , " I Like Ike " . It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt 's policy at Yalta and against Truman 's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated . In defeating Taft for the nomination , it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party ; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose . Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike 's more advanced age .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal . Of these , Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres ( 3,900–7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres ( 6,900–10,800 ft ) . Under Köppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( Cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . In the Kathmandu Valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C ( 82–86 °F ) . The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C ( 50.2 °F ) .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ—as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader , the House Majority Leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House . Typically , the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . In some cases , Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker ; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert . In addition , Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor .
The enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu . " Narayanhity " comes from Narayana , a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu , and Hiti , meaning " water spout " ( Vishnu 's temple is located opposite the palace , and the water spout is located east of the main entrance to the precinct ) . Narayanhity was a new palace , in front of the old palace built in 1915 , and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary Pagoda . It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah , then heir apparent to the throne . The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads . The palace area covers ( 30 hectares ( 74 acres ) ) and is fully secured with gates on all sides . This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre . After the fall of the monarchy , it was converted to a museum .
Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection . Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection . There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body . Some viruses once acquired never leave the body . A typical example is the herpes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
His primary duty was planning for the next war , which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression . He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur , Army Chief of Staff . In 1932 , he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington , D.C . Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it , he later wrote the Army 's official incident report , endorsing MacArthur 's conduct .
Prior to his inauguration , Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the Korean War to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy . His inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of first-century Christianity . Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body , which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture . The Governing Body does not issue any single , comprehensive " statement of faith " , but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society . Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation , in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose , and that such enlightenment or " new light " results from the application of reason and study , the guidance of the holy spirit , and direction from Jesus Christ and angels . The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern " deep truths " , which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions . The religion 's leadership , while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility , is said to provide " divine guidance " through its teachings described as " based on God 's Word thus ... not from men , but from Jehovah . "
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . In this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut .
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate , Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea 's Hellenised elite . Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them . Early Italian synagogues have left few traces ; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period . Judaea 's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora ; in Rome , this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion . Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by Julius Caesar . By the Augustan era , the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews . In some periods under Roman rule , Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice , under certain conditions . Judaism was a superstitio to Cicero , but the Church Father Tertullian described it as religio licita ( an officially permitted religion ) in contrast to Christianity .
Romulus was credited with several religious institutions . He founded the Consualia festival , inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate ; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus 's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome 's myth of origins . As a successful general , Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome 's first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the spolia opima , the prime spoils taken in war , in the celebration of the first Roman triumph . Spared a mortal 's death , Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified .
Eric P. Hamp in his 2012 Indo-European family tree , groups the Armenian language along with Greek and Ancient Macedonian ( " Helleno-Macedonian " ) in the Pontic Indo-European ( also called Helleno-Armenian ) subgroup . In Hamp 's view the homeland of this subgroup is the northeast coast of the Black Sea and its hinterlands . He assumes that they migrated from there southeast through the Caucasus with the Armenians remaining after Batumi while the pre-Greeks proceeded westwards along the southern coast of the Black Sea .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
The Bronx 's evolution from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop was the subject of an award-winning documentary , produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS in 2006 , " From Mambo to Hip Hop : A South Bronx Tale " . Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s . The New York Times has identified 1520 Sedgwick Avenue " an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway " as a starting point , where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community room .
Throughout his presidency , Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism . A self-described " progressive conservative , " he continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation , especially Social Security . He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers . He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years , which had not been completed under Truman .
Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-four , and Alan Rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over Witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation " , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control .
When the White House is controlled by the House majority party , then the House minority leader assumes a larger role in formulating alternatives to executive branch initiatives and in acting as a national spokesperson for his or her party . " As Minority Leader during [ President Lyndon Johnson 's ] Democratic administration , my responsibility has been to propose Republican alternatives , " said Minority Leader Gerald Ford , R-MI . Greatly outnumbered in the House , Minority Leader Ford devised a political strategy that allowed Republicans to offer their alternatives in a manner that provided them political protection . As Ford explained :
On December 20 , 2005 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed , because the purpose of the display ( educating the public on American legal traditions ) was secular in nature . In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3 , 2006 , however , a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed .
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
Jefferson and James Madison 's conceptions of separation have long been debated . Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency , though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia . Madison issued four religious proclamations while President , but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment . On the other hand , both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol . Years before the ratification of the Constitution , Madison contended " Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large , still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body . " After retiring from the presidency , Madison wrote of " total separation of the church from the state . " " " Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States , " Madison wrote , and he declared , " practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . " In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded , " We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts . do better without Kings & Nobles than with them . The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Govt . " Madison 's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States , as well as the Federal Government , from an establishment of religion , but the House did not pass them .

The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond . Terence , an African and a former slave , was well placed to preach the message of universalism , of the essential unity of the human race , that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks , but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality . The influence of Terence 's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated . Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call :
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders . When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah 's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt , provide help and possibly administer discipline . Disfellowshipping , a form of shunning , is the strongest form of discipline , administered to an offender deemed unrepentant . Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home , and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement ; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged . Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that " losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [ the shunned individual ] to come 'to his senses , ' see the seriousness of his wrong , and take steps to return to Jehovah . " The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior . Members who disassociate ( formally resign ) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned . Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced . Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin ; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service , but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship . Marking , a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship , is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin .

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the English language in this sense . The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when German historian and philologist Georg Voigt used humanism to describe Renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the Italian Renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially Italy .
According to the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-Hispanic Black or African American , 10.9 % of the population was non-Hispanic White , 3.4 % non-Hispanic Asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-Hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-Hispanic ) . The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
Believers in Pashupatinath ( mainly Hindus ) are allowed to enter the temple premises , but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River . The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka , South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla . This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam ( Unified India ) by encouraging cultural exchange . This procedure is followed in other temples around India , which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya .
Most videos enable users to leave comments , and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content . In 2006 , Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling " community and collaboration on a scale never seen before " , and added that YouTube " harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom . Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone , never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred " . The Guardian in 2009 described users ' comments on YouTube as :
South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to South America 's distinctive marsupial faunas . The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean . Africa 's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea , cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean . Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia . Near the end of the Pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the Quaternary Period ) , the current ice age began . The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals . Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire : in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors . Ambrose , the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus 's request for tolerance . Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of Rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] He was the last emperor of both East and West .
Soteriologically , most Methodists are Arminian , emphasizing that Christ accomplished salvation for every human being , and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it ( as opposed to the traditional Calvinist doctrine of monergism ) . Methodism is traditionally low church in liturgy , although this varies greatly between individual congregations ; the Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition ; John Wesley 's brother , Charles , was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church , and many other eminent hymn writers come from the Methodist tradition .
His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading . Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children , and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline , usually from David . His mother , previously a member ( with David ) of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites , joined the International Bible Students Association , later known as Jehovah 's Witnesses . The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 , though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students . His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother , who felt that warfare was " rather wicked , " but she did not overrule him . While speaking of himself in 1948 , Eisenhower said he was " one of the most deeply religious men I know " though unattached to any " sect or organization " . He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953 .
Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages . The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
From the early 16th century , both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule . Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia , significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires . From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya , and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century , Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid , Afsharid and Qajar empires , while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule . In the late 1820s , the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan ( all of Eastern Armenia ) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran 's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War ( 1826-1828 ) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay . Western Armenia however , remained in Ottoman hands .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
Some legal scholars , such as John Baker of LSU , theorize that Madison 's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " —was rejected by the House , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists . To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown . During the debate over the establishment clause , Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison 's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
Religious humanism is an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that centre on human needs , interests , and abilities . Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of " humanism " until the late 19th and early 20th centuries , non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history . The Cult of Reason ( French : Culte de la Raison ) was a religion based on deism devised during the French Revolution by Jacques Hébert , Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters . In 1793 during the French Revolution , the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a " Temple to Reason " and for a time Lady Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars . In the 1850s , Auguste Comte , the Father of Sociology , founded Positivism , a " religion of humanity " . One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London . This early group was democratically organised , with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences , philosophy , and the arts . The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876 . The movement 's founder , Felix Adler , a former member of the Free Religious Association , conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions . Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people 's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel , who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ . In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exhaltation of Adam . In the apse the Ascension of Christ . The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha . It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches , each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra , om mani padme hum . At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima , the goddess of smallpox . Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure , walk around the stupa with prayer wheels , chant , and pray . Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex . The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas ( monasteries ) around Boudhanath .
In 2003 , the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania . The panels depict real or fantastic animal , floral , solar and geometric representations . Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church , built some time between the 10th and 11th century . Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence . The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary .
Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff , but did not affect the campaign . One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust . Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage , but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates . The second issue centered on Eisenhower 's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance . Just two weeks prior to the election , Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there . He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO ; finally , he stressed a corruption-free , frugal administration at home .
In November 1956 , Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British , French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis , receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt . Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith ( see Christian Humanism ) . They inveighed against the abuses of the Church , but not against the Church itself , much less against religion . For them , the word " secular " carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later , in the nineteenth century . In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery . Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo 's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own ( although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life ) . He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue , inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer . By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base , however , the methods of the humanists , combined with their eloquence , would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority .
A loblolly pine , known as the " Eisenhower Pine " , was located on Augusta 's 17th hole , approximately 210 yards ( 192 m ) from the Masters tee . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , an Augusta National member , hit the tree so many times that , at a 1956 club meeting , he proposed that it be cut down . Not wanting to offend the president , the club 's chairman , Clifford Roberts , immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request . The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage .
According to Der Spiegel , credits given to European governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives . A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that " The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " In previous years , Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank . " These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines . In May 2010 , the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and Great Britain third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP during 2010 .
The Bronx has several local newspapers , including The Bronx News , Parkchester News , City News , The Riverdale Press , Riverdale Review , The Bronx Times Reporter , Inner City Press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and Co-Op City Times . Four non-profit news outlets , Norwood News , Mount Hope Monitor , Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough 's poorer communities . The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press , Bernard Stein , won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998 . ( Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959 . )
In terms of ship categories , Greek companies have 22.6 % of the world 's tankers and 16.1 % of the world 's bulk carriers ( in dwt ) . An additional equivalent of 27.45 % of the world 's tanker dwt is on order , with another 12.7 % of bulk carriers also on order . Shipping accounts for an estimated 6 % of Greek GDP , employs about 160,000 people ( 4 % of the workforce ) , and represents 1/3 of the country 's trade deficit . Earnings from shipping amounted to €14.1 billion in 2011 , while between 2000 and 2010 Greek shipping contributed a total of €140 billion ( half of the country 's public debt in 2009 and 3.5 times the receipts from the European Union in the period 2000–2013 ) . The 2011 ECSA report showed that there are approximately 750 Greek shipping companies in operation .
Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-four , and Alan Rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over Witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation " , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control .
In contrast , the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions . To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law , some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts can not be obtained in time , and where , without interference of the police , the realization of the private right would be impeded . This would , for example , allow police to establish a restaurant guest 's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest can not pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns . Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound , T. E. Hulme , and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental " slop " ( Hulme ) [ citation needed ] or " an old bitch gone in the teeth " ( Pound ) and wanted to go back to a more manly , authoritarian society such as ( they believed ) existed in the Middle Ages . Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists , such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault , have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature , which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human . " Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal " , suggests Timothy Laurie , turning the human into what he calls " a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans ( e.g . rationality , altruism ) , rather than most commonplace ( e.g . hunger , anger ) " . Nevertheless , philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals , anti-humanism thus frequently " secretes a humanist rhetoric " .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
The onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . June and July are oppressively hot . Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °C , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °C . In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . The hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late October .
Praça dos Três Poderes ( Portuguese for Square of the Three Powers ) is a plaza in Brasília . The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza : the Executive , represented by the Palácio do Planalto ( presidential office ) ; the Legislative , represented by the National Congress ( Congresso Nacional ) ; and the Judicial branch , represented by the Supreme Federal Court ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) . It is a tourist attraction in Brasília , designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously .
All police officers in the United Kingdom , whatever their actual rank , are 'constables ' in terms of their legal position . This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner . However , certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations , such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect 's house ( section 18 PACE in England and Wales ) by an officer of the rank of Inspector , or the power to authorize a suspect 's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent .
Since the 19th century , many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or " gatekeeper " , sometimes described as the President 's Private Secretary , sometimes with no official title at all . Eisenhower formalized this role , introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army . Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position . Initially , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff , but each eventually appointed one .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons . First , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified . Second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease . This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR . Third , the essential tools for directing PCR , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery , located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds , hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors , and regularly organizes exhibitions . It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art . Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery , located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house , giving an important insight into Nepali history . The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu , near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg , Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent , established Nepali painters . The Nepal Art Council Gallery , located in the Babar Mahal , on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions .
In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level . In 1773 , Isaac Backus , a prominent Baptist minister in New England , wrote against a state sanctioned religion , saying : " Now who can hear Christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? " He also observed that when " church and state are separate , the effects are happy , and they do not at all interfere with each other : but where they have been confounded together , no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued . " Thomas Jefferson 's influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786 , five years before the Bill of Rights .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries , most notably with Nicolas Delamare 's Traité de la Police ( " Treatise on the Police " ) , first published in 1705 . The German Polizeiwissenschaft ( Science of Police ) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police . Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften ( 1937 ) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however , this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault 's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850 .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
Chthonic gods such as Dis pater , the di inferi ( " gods below " ) , and the collective shades of the departed ( di Manes ) were given dark , fertile victims in nighttime rituals . Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering , and there was no shared banquet , as " the living can not share a meal with the dead " . Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals ; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival . Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices . Demigods and heroes , who belonged to the heavens and the underworld , were sometimes given black-and-white victims . Robigo ( or Robigus ) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew .
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-four , and Alan Rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over Witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation " , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control .
Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe , although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals . The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár ( Alba Regia ) had a mosaic decoration in the apse . It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen , executed in the first decades of the 11th century . The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century . The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal . It was executed by Venetian craftsmen .
The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement . Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles , gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way ( via media ) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions . The English Reformation followed a particular course . The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII . King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome . In 1534 , the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . Between 1535 and 1540 , under Thomas Cromwell , the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect . Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I , a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I . The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition . The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other . It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century .
The Bronx 's evolution from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop was the subject of an award-winning documentary , produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS in 2006 , " From Mambo to Hip Hop : A South Bronx Tale " . Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s . The New York Times has identified 1520 Sedgwick Avenue " an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway " as a starting point , where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community room .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .
The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map , made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba , Jordan . It was rediscovered in 1894 . The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land . It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south , and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert . The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem , at the center of the map . The map is enriched with many naturalistic features , like animals , fishing boats , bridges and palm trees
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
The city 's planned design included specific areas for almost everything , including accommodation , Hotels Sectors North and South . New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere , such as the hotels and tourism Sector North , located on the shores of Lake Paranoá . Brasília has a range of tourist accommodation from inns , pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels . The city 's restaurants cater to a wide range of foods from local and regional Brazilian dishes to international cuisine .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later Middle Ages and the Early Modern period . The 19th-century German historian Georg Voigt ( 1827–91 ) identified Petrarch as the first Renaissance humanist . Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was " the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness " . According to Petrarch , what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors . For Petrarch and Boccaccio , the greatest master was Cicero , whose prose became the model for both learned ( Latin ) and vernacular ( Italian ) prose .
The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar , who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy ; he was murdered soon after . Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors , and offered similar cult to Caesar 's successor , Augustus , who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship ; it might prove fatal . By the end of his reign , Augustus had appropriated Rome 's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his " reformed " and thoroughly integrated system of government . Towards the end of his life , he cautiously allowed cult to his numen . By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed , first in the Eastern Provinces , then in the West . Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context ; bathhouses , shrines and temples to Roman and local deities , amphitheatres and festivals . In the early Imperial period , the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship .
In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 7.2 % it accounted for in 2006 , but still below the EU average of 10 % in 2008 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . In 2013 and for several months , Greece produced more than 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples ( such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription ) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters ' territories , and which later became a kingdom . At its zenith ( 95–65 BC ) , the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey , Lebanon , and northern Iran . The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
Kathmandu ( /ˌkɑːtmɑːnˈduː/ ; Nepali pronunciation : [ kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu ] ) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal . It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar ( Metropolitan City ) , as compared to Upa-Mahanagar ( Sub-Metropolitan City ) or Nagar ( City ) . Kathmandu is the core of Nepal 's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi , Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities . Kathmandu is also known informally as " KTM " or the " tri-city " . According to the 2011 census , Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures 49.45 km2 ( 19.09 sq mi ) .
The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time , as individual scientists , associations and universities were vying for limited resources . There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public , or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities . Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors , and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions , they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors .
The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball . The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue , a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships . With the famous facade , the short right field porch and Monument Park , Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball 's greatest players including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Whitey Ford , Yogi Berra , Mickey Mantle , Reggie Jackson , Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
Sociologist Rodney Stark states that Jehovah 's Witness leaders are " not always very democratic " and that members " are expected to conform to rather strict standards , " but adds that " enforcement tends to be very informal , sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group " , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as " part of the power structure rather than subject to it . " Sociologist Andrew Holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah 's Witnesses have made an informed choice . However , he also states that defectors " are seldom allowed a dignified exit " , and describes the administration as autocratic .
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .
After fourteen consecutive years of economic growth , Greece went into recession in 2008 . By the end of 2009 , the Greek economy faced the highest budget deficit and government debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU . After several upward revisions , the 2009 budget deficit is now estimated at 15.7 % of GDP . This , combined with rapidly rising debt levels ( 127.9 % of GDP in 2009 ) led to a precipitous increase in borrowing costs , effectively shutting Greece out of the global financial markets and resulting in a severe economic crisis .
The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold . Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus . Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths . In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .
Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions , many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx . The New York City Department of Education manages public noncharter schools in the borough . In 2000 , public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx 's residents over 3 years old ( out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools ) . There are also several public charter schools . Private schools range from élite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud 's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner 's Behaviorism . The approach emphasizes an individual 's inherent drive towards self-actualization and creativity . Psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow introduced a positive , humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s . Other sources include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
All Protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the Church universal and generally deny the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . The various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the Bible alone ( rather than with Catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The " Five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of the day .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church’s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
Among the vast varieties of microorganisms , relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals . Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect . The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen , depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen . However a host 's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection . Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens :
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
In Miranda the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest . The court held that " The prosecution may not use statements , whether exculpatory or inculpatory , stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way , unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment 's privilege against self-incrimination "
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " The practice was a mark of the " Other " , attributed to Rome 's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls . Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain . Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere .
At the end of May 1942 , Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold , commanding general of the Army Air Forces , to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England , Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney . He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment , stating he had an " uneasy feeling " about Chaney and his staff . On June 23 , 1942 , he returned to London as Commanding General , European Theater of Operations ( ETOUSA ) , based in London and with a house on Coombe , Kingston upon Thames , and replaced Chaney . He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7 .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as : Bhavani , Durga , Gaja-Lakshmi , Hariti-Sitala , Mahsishamardini , Saptamatrika ( seven mother goddesses ) , and Sri-Lakshmi ( wealth-goddess ) . From the 3rd century BC , apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses , Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period ( it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC ) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular . These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution : the Licchavi or classical period ( 500 to 900 AD ) , the post-classical period ( 1000 to 1400 AD ) , with strong influence of the Palla art form ; the Malla period ( 1400 onwards ) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology .
Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations , including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ , both in the United States and elsewhere . There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide , and the movement is growing in many parts of the world , especially the global South . Since the 1960s , Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions , and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement . Together , Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents .

After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna . The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century . Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo . The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest . The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549 . The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco , executed in 545–547 ( largely destroyed ; the remains in Berlin ) .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
In America , Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement 's seminal influence . In the United Kingdom , Colin Urquhart , Michael Harper , David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments . The Massey conference in New Zealand , 1964 was attended by several Anglicans , including the Rev . Ray Muller , who went on to invite Bennett to New Zealand in 1966 , and played a leading role in developing and promoting the Life in the Spirit seminars . Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky .
Jeffries and Ryan ( 2001 ) argue that the modern concept of separation of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court . The central point , they argue , was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools , followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education . Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause .
Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . Ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . Witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins .
Jefferson 's concept of " separation of church and state " first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S. , 98 U.S. 145 ( 1878 ) . In that case , the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US , determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom , " The word 'religion ' is not defined in the Constitution . We must go elsewhere , therefore , to ascertain its meaning , and nowhere more appropriately , we think , than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted . " The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . Quoting the " separation " paragraph from Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , the court concluded that , " coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure , it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . "
Since then , the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party 's nominee for President , starting with a vote of 2-1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928 , followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt . ( Both had been Governors of New York , but Republican former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey won only 28 % of the Bronx 's vote in 1948 against 55 % for Pres . Harry Truman , the winning Democrat , and 17 % for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives . It was only 32 years earlier , by contrast , that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency , Charles Evans Hughes , had won 42.6 % of the Bronx 's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson 's 49.8 % and Socialist candidate Allan Benson 's 7.3 % . )
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
In Canada , the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was founded in 1729 , making it the first police force in present-day Canada . It was followed in 1834 by the Toronto Police , and in 1838 by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City . A national force , the Dominion Police , was founded in 1868 . Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament , but its responsibilities quickly grew . The famous Royal Northwest Mounted Police was founded in 1873 . The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers . Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards . It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk , sugar and spices . Alcohol is widely drunk , and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages . Drinking and driving is illegal , and authorities have a zero tolerance policy . Ailaa and thwon ( alcohol made from rice ) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu , found in all the local bhattis ( alcohol serving eateries ) . Chhyaang , tongba ( fermented millet or barley ) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu . However , shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers .
In the original city plan , the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station . Because of the growth of Brasília ( and corresponding growth in the bus fleet ) , today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station ( called Rodoferroviária ) , located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental . The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station . A new bus station was opened in July 2010 . It is on Saída Sul ( South Exit ) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station , and it 's also an inter-state bus station , used only to leave the Federal District .
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
Angels in the Outfield was Eisenhower 's favorite movie . His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels of Zane Grey . With his excellent memory and ability to focus , Eisenhower was skilled at card games . He learned poker , which he called his " favorite indoor sport , " in Abilene . Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates ' poker losses for payment after graduation , and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him . A classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point , Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level . In 1773 , Isaac Backus , a prominent Baptist minister in New England , wrote against a state sanctioned religion , saying : " Now who can hear Christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? " He also observed that when " church and state are separate , the effects are happy , and they do not at all interfere with each other : but where they have been confounded together , no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued . " Thomas Jefferson 's influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786 , five years before the Bill of Rights .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns ; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae , and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës , Albania in 1916 , is an early figural example ; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC . Mythological subjects , or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy , were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design , with strongly emphasized borders . Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name , describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl . Both of these themes were widely copied .
Internal party disunity compounded the difficulty of identifying lawmakers who might have informally functioned as a minority leader . For instance , " seven of the fourteen speakership elections from 1834 through 1859 had at least twenty different candidates in the field . Thirty-six competed in 1839 , ninety-seven in 1849 , ninety-one in 1859 , and 138 in 1855 . " With so many candidates competing for the speakership , it is not at all clear that one of the defeated lawmakers then assumed the mantle of " minority leader . " The Democratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not " nominate a candidate for Speaker in two of these seven Congresses and nominated no man more than once in the other five . The defeated candidates were not automatically looked to for leadership . "
When infection attacks the body , anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection . Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist , depending on the type of organism targeted ; they include antibacterial ( antibiotic ; including antitubercular ) , antiviral , antifungal and antiparasitic ( including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic ) agents . Depending on the severity and the type of infection , the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection , or may be applied topically . Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics . Sometimes , multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic . Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses . Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria . The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin , cephalosporins , aminoglycosides , macrolides , quinolones and tetracyclines . [ citation needed ]
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 . In November 2008 , YouTube reached an agreement with MGM , Lions Gate Entertainment , and CBS , allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site , accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called " Shows " . The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu , which features material from NBC , Fox , and Disney . In November 2009 , YouTube launched a version of " Shows " available to UK viewers , offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners . In January 2010 , YouTube introduced an online film rentals service , which is available only to users in the US , Canada and the UK as of 2010 . The service offers over 6,000 films .
Subsequent to this decision , the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause , known as the " Lemon Test " . First , the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose . Second , the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . Third , the statute or policy must not result in an " excessive entanglement " of government with religion . ( The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools , and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church 's religious mission , thus the policy involved the state in an " excessive entanglement " with religion . ) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause .
The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians ; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic , and the proprietors of Perth Amboy , New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers . The Province of West Jersey had declared , in 1681 , that there should be no religious test for office . An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope , which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution . That law was replaced by 1799 .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942 . Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . He organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . Knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding Witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code .
On the morning of March 28 , 1969 , at the age of 78 , Eisenhower died in Washington , D.C. of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The following day his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral 's Bethlehem Chapel , where he lay in repose for 28 hours . On March 30 , his body was brought by caisson to the United States Capitol , where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda . On March 31 , Eisenhower 's body was returned to the National Cathedral , where he was given an Episcopal Church funeral service .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
Since then , tourism in Nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu 's religious sites such as Pashupatinath , Swayambhunath , Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha . From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000 . Following the end of the Maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . Since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic . In economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of Internet use , with the gap closing rapidly in recent years . The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , from 23 % to 56 % respectively ( compared with an EU average of 49 % and 79 % ) . At the same time , there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection , from 4 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2013 ( compared with an EU average of 30 % and 76 % ) . However , Greece also has the EU 's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet : 36 % in 2013 , down from 65 % in 2006 ( compared with an EU average of 21 % and 42 % ) .
In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war . Believing that a general should not participate in politics , one author later wrote that " figuratively speaking , [ Eisenhower ] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office " . As others asked him about his political future , Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job " from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe " , and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions . In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired , the president would help the general win the 1948 election , and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower 's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination .
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003–04 . This fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . In view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in Kathmandu are mainly by road and air . Kathmandu is connected by the Tribhuvan Highway to the south , Prithvi Highway to the west and Araniko Highway to the north . The BP Highway , connecting Kathmandu to the eastern part of Nepal is under construction .
The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson ( later U.S. president ) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House , both from Texas . Joe Martin , the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that Eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . There were exceptions , Leonard W. Hall , for example , who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . However , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
Colloquially , the term university may be used to describe a phase in one 's life : " When I was at university ... " ( in the United States and Ireland , college is often used instead : " When I was in college ... " ) . In Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Nigeria , the Netherlands , Spain and the German-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni . In Ghana , New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called " varsity " ( although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years ) . " Varsity " was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] " Varsity " is still in common usage in Scotland .
Jefferson and James Madison 's conceptions of separation have long been debated . Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency , though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia . Madison issued four religious proclamations while President , but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment . On the other hand , both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol . Years before the ratification of the Constitution , Madison contended " Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large , still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body . " After retiring from the presidency , Madison wrote of " total separation of the church from the state . " " " Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States , " Madison wrote , and he declared , " practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . " In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded , " We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts . do better without Kings & Nobles than with them . The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Govt . " Madison 's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States , as well as the Federal Government , from an establishment of religion , but the House did not pass them . [ citation needed ]
On the other hand , in his study on nine of " the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world " , Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn , Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University , wrote : “The NW [ New World Translation ] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators , BeDuhn stated : “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal , conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament " violate [ s ] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God " .
Rome had no separate priestly caste or class . The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices , officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes . Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation . In household cult , the paterfamilias functioned as priest , and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants . Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise . The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines ( the singular is flamen ) , attributed to king Numa : the major flamines , dedicated to Jupiter , Mars and Quirinus , were traditionally drawn from patrician families . Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity , whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some . Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity ; Jupiter 's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career .
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
The humanists ' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods . By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin , they applied the principle of ad fontes , or back to the sources , across broad areas of learning , seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors . In 1439 , while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon ( at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States ) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis , now called philology , to prove that the Donation of Constantine , which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome , was an 8th-century forgery . For the next 70 years , however , neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way . Instead , after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453 , which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy , humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism , hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches , and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world . The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts , not only of Plato and Aristotle , but also of the Christian Gospels , previously unavailable in the Latin West .
During the late 1920s and early 1930s , Eisenhower 's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat , as military priorities diminished ; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs . He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing , and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower , then a journalist at the Agriculture Department , he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe . He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928 . After a one-year assignment in France , Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely , Assistant Secretary of War , from 1929 to February 1933 . Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Industrial College ( Washington , DC ) in 1933 and later served on the faculty ( it was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy ) .
Officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " The practice was a mark of the " Other " , attributed to Rome 's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls . Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain . Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere .
A Vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and Roman matron and wife . Unlike male priests , Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of Rome .
Steven Waldman notes that ; " The evangelicals provided the political muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson , not merely because they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep the spiritual and secular worlds apart . " " Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners , " writes the historian Frank Lambert in his book The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America . " New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state . "
The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time , as individual scientists , associations and universities were vying for limited resources . There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public , or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities . Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors , and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions , they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors .
World literature was enriched by the works of Edmund Spenser , John Milton , John Bunyan , John Donne , John Dryden , Daniel Defoe , William Wordsworth , Jonathan Swift , Johann Wolfgang Goethe , Friedrich Schiller , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Edgar Allan Poe , Matthew Arnold , Conrad Ferdinand Meyer , Theodor Fontane , Washington Irving , Robert Browning , Emily Dickinson , Emily Brontë , Charles Dickens , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Thomas Stearns Eliot , John Galsworthy , Thomas Mann , William Faulkner , John Updike , and many others .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement .
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960 . A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858 . Each of the designs incorporates the text " with appreciation " or " with personal and official gratitude " accompanied with Eisenhower 's initials " D.D.E . " or facsimile signature . The design also incorporates location , date , and/or significant event . Prior to the end of his second term as President , 1,451 medals were turned-in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed . The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
Kathmandu ( /ˌkɑːtmɑːnˈduː/ ; Nepali pronunciation : [ kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu ] ) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal . It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar ( Metropolitan City ) , as compared to Upa-Mahanagar ( Sub-Metropolitan City ) or Nagar ( City ) . Kathmandu is the core of Nepal 's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi , Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities . Kathmandu is also known informally as " KTM " or the " tri-city " . According to the 2011 census , Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures 49.45 km2 ( 19.09 sq mi ) .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
Valerian 's first religious edict singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult , outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome 's traditional gods . His second edict acknowledged a Christian threat to the Imperial system – not yet at its heart but close to it , among Rome’s equites and Senators . Christian apologists interpreted his disgraceful capture and death as divine judgement . The next forty years were peaceful ; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile , due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence . Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius ' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a “pagan” basis in Christian heresies . The Christian churches were disunited ; Paul of Samosata , Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 for " dogmatic reasons – his doctrine on the human nature of Christ was rejected – and for his lifestyle , which reminded his brethren of the habits of the administrative elite " . The reasons for his deposition were widely circulated among the churches . Meanwhile , Aurelian ( 270-75 ) appealed for harmony among his soldiers ( concordia militum ) , stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official , Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome 's Campus Martius .
Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely , particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany . They included nonconformists like the Puritans , who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England . Despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches . The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established Church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .
Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual ; in effect they were Rome in miniature . The commander 's headquarters stood at the centre ; he took the auspices on a dais in front . A small building behind housed the legionary standards , the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era , the image of the ruling emperor . In one camp , this shrine is even called Capitolium . The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major , set battle . A ram , a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded , led around the outer perimeter of the camp ( a lustratio exercitus ) and in through a gate , then sacrificed : Trajan 's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars . The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum ; all within are purified and protected .
The Cathedral of Brasília in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil , is an expression of the architect Oscar Niemeyer . This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure , seems with its glass roof reaching up , open , to the heavens . On 31 May 1970 , the Cathedral’s structure was finished , and only the 70 m ( 229.66 ft ) diameter of the circular area were visible . Niemeyer 's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric . The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns . These columns , having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t , represent two hands moving upwards to heaven . The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970 .
The Portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum . The city has six international schools : American School of Brasília , Brasília International School ( BIS ) , Escola das Nações , Swiss International School ( SIS ) , Lycée français François-Mitterrand ( LfFM ) and Maple Bear Canadian School . August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - The British School of Brasilia . Brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
This prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy 's highly criticized methods against communism . To facilitate relations with Congress , Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy 's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the White House . This position drew criticism from a number of corners . In late 1953 McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 Senate elections . Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists . Nevertheless , he refused .
South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to South America 's distinctive marsupial faunas . The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean . Africa 's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea , cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean . Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia . Near the end of the Pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the Quaternary Period ) , the current ice age began . The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
Institute of Medicine , the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is located in Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . It was established in 1972 and started to impart medical education from 1978 . A number of medical colleges including Kathmandu Medical College , Nepal Medical College , KIST Medical College , Nepal Army Institute of Health Sciences , National Academy of Medical Sciences ( NAMS ) and Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences ( KUSMS ) , are also located in or around Kathmandu .
Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term , but as with other decisions , he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again . During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 , he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP 's potential candidates ; the group , in addition to his doctor , concluded a second term was well advised , and he announced in February 1956 he would run again . Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon 's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket ; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition . He personally favored Robert B. Anderson , a Democrat , who rejected his offer ; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party . In 1956 , Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide , with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6 % of the popular vote . The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology . Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
Kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . The average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley : south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City ( Patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by Kirtipur Municipality and to the east by Madyapur Thimi Municipality . To the north the urban area extends into several Village Development Committees . However , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley .
In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation , the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough . Radical Reformer , Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt , for example , referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the " new papists " . Since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes . A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut , although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
Until March 1 , 2009 , the Borough President of the Bronx was Adolfo Carrión Jr. , elected as a Democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy . His successor , Democratic New York State Assembly member Rubén Díaz , Jr. , who won a special election on April 21 , 2009 by a vote of 86.3 % ( 29,420 ) on the " Bronx Unity " line to 13.3 % ( 4,646 ) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the " People First " line , became Borough President on May 1 .
Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
Protestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation , today regarded as branches . Some of these movements have a common lineage , sometimes directly spawning individual denominations . Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations , this section discusses only the largest denominational families , or branches , widely considered to be a part of Protestantism . These are , in alphabetical order : Adventist , Anglican , Baptist , Calvinist ( Reformed ) , Lutheran , Methodist and Pentecostal . A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
As a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece 's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country 's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7 % in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) . In order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries , and the IMF , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling €110 billion . In order to secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control . Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .
The Plymouth Brethren are a conservative , low church , evangelical movement , whose history can be traced to Dublin , Ireland , in the late 1820s , originating from Anglicanism . Among other beliefs , the group emphasizes sola scriptura . Brethren generally see themselves not as a denomination , but as a network , or even as a collection of overlapping networks , of like-minded independent churches . Although the group refused for many years to take any denominational name to itself—a stance that some of them still maintain—the title The Brethren , is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as brethren .
In 1948 , Eisenhower became President of Columbia University , an Ivy League university in New York City . The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction . During that year Eisenhower 's memoir , Crusade in Europe , was published . Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs , and it was a major financial success as well . Eisenhower 's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer , but rather , marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences , and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $ 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate . This ruling saved Eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress , with results , " often the reverse of what he has desired " because Members of Congress , " resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this ' . The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking . "
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
Like other neighborhoods in New York City , the South Bronx has no official boundaries . The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham Road was often used as a northern limit . The Bronx River more consistently forms an eastern boundary . The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi-unit homes . The South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse , Borough Hall , and other government buildings , as well as Yankee Stadium . The Cross Bronx Expressway bisects it , east to west . The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
During the Reformation , the term was hardly used outside of the German politics . The word evangelical ( German : evangelisch ) , which refers to the gospel , was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement . Nowadays , this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations , above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD . The German word evangelisch means Protestant , and is different from the German evangelikal , which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism . The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches , and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole . It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England , where Evangelicalism originated , and then was brought to the United States . The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German , and is different from English reformed ( German : reformiert ) , which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians .
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available . The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable . The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) . These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins . A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
The major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in Brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . Industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8 % , Services 28.7 % , Industry 10.2 % , Commerce 6.1 % , Agribusiness 0.2 % .
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .

Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília . The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras ( " superblocks " ) : groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools , retail stores , and open spaces . At the northern end of Lake Paranoá , separated from the inner city , is a peninsula with many fashionable homes , and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore . Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake , but during early development private clubs , hotels , and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water . Set well apart from the city are satellite cities , including Gama , Ceilândia , Taguatinga , Núcleo Bandeirante , Sobradinho , and Planaltina . These cities , with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned .
In Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 ( 1968 ) , the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime " to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals , " or " to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches " this theory in any school or university that received public funds . The court 's opinion , written by Justice Abe Fortas , ruled that the Arkansas law violated " the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . The overriding fact is that Arkansas ' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine ; that is , with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group . " The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion , and that " [ T ] he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them . "
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal . Of these , Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres ( 3,900–7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres ( 6,900–10,800 ft ) . Under Köppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( Cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . In the Kathmandu Valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C ( 82–86 °F ) . The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C ( 50.2 °F ) .
Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . A cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells . The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well . Two methods , the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease . The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria , both of which contain many significant human pathogens . The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia .
In the immediate years after Eisenhower left office , his reputation declined . He was widely seen by critics as an inactive , uninspiring , golf-playing president compared to his vigorous young successor . Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock , Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted . Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment , for the Soviet Union 's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race , and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism .
To a large extent , the minority leader 's position is a 20th-century innovation . Prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized , so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader . Decades went by before anything like the modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders . However , from the beginning days of Congress , various House members intermittently assumed the role of " opposition leader . " Some scholars suggest that Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned as the first " minority leader " because in the First Congress he led the opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton 's fiscal policies .
In the course of this religious upheaval , the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 swept through the Bavarian , Thuringian and Swabian principalities . After the Eighty Years ' War in the Low Countries and the French Wars of Religion , the confessional division of the states of the Holy Roman Empire eventually erupted in the Thirty Years ' War between 1618 and 1648 . It devastated much of Germany , killing between 25 % and 40 % of its population . The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , were :
Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of Internet use , with the gap closing rapidly in recent years . The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , from 23 % to 56 % respectively ( compared with an EU average of 49 % and 79 % ) . At the same time , there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection , from 4 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2013 ( compared with an EU average of 30 % and 76 % ) . However , Greece also has the EU 's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet : 36 % in 2013 , down from 65 % in 2006 ( compared with an EU average of 21 % and 42 % ) .
While the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . During the Punic crisis , popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy ; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with Roman Bacchus . Official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . Much later , a statue of Marsyas , the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus ' censorship . Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . Where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; Liber 's festival continued .
In 1963 , the Robbins Report on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian 's reign . The figures , animals , plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background . The portrait of a moustached man , probably a Gothic chieftain , is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age . The so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II 's reign around 565–577 . Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room . The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition . There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki ( 5th–6th centuries ) .
The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society . In the middle Republican era , even Scipio 's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter 's special protege sat ill with his colleagues . Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal ; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus . Julius Caesar went further , and claimed her as his ancestress . Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired ; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation . In 63 BC , Julius Caesar 's appointment as pontifex maximus " signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics " . Likewise , political candidates could sponsor temples , priesthoods and the immensely popular , spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic . Under the principate , such opportunities were limited by law ; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ( " first citizen " ) .
Islamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire . In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art . During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world , although tile was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration .
The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma . During the Silurian , Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation . The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Rheic Ocean , a seaway of Iapetus Ocean ( now in between Avalonia and Laurentia ) , and newly formed Ural Ocean .
In the later Imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped . Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica . The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; St Augustine ( following St Ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567 . Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities , resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices . In one decade , the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001 . The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021 . To keep up this population growth , the KMC-controlled area of 5,076.6 hectares ( 12,545 acres ) has expanded to 8,214 hectares ( 20,300 acres ) in 2001 . With this new area , the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001 ; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021 .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah 's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory . In 1933 , there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses in Germany , of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned . Of those , 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . In Canada , Jehovah 's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent . In the former Soviet Union , about 9,300 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951 . Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including China , Vietnam and some Islamic states .
Many scholars ( including Makdisi ) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus , the Emirate of Sicily , and the Middle East ( during the Crusades ) . Other scholars see this argument as overstated . Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education , turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 . In November 2008 , YouTube reached an agreement with MGM , Lions Gate Entertainment , and CBS , allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site , accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called " Shows " . The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu , which features material from NBC , Fox , and Disney . In November 2009 , YouTube launched a version of " Shows " available to UK viewers , offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners . In January 2010 , YouTube introduced an online film rentals service , which is available only to users in the US , Canada and the UK as of 2010 . The service offers over 6,000 films .
The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism , but in 380 under Theodosius I , Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire . Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus ( d. 402 ) were rejected . Christianity became increasingly popular . Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution , but Rome 's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms , and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
The Bronx has several local newspapers , including The Bronx News , Parkchester News , City News , The Riverdale Press , Riverdale Review , The Bronx Times Reporter , Inner City Press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and Co-Op City Times . Four non-profit news outlets , Norwood News , Mount Hope Monitor , Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough 's poorer communities . The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press , Bernard Stein , won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998 . ( Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959 . )
Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada . Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization , more than 4000 years ago . The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa . The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation . The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River . This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan . Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found . Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas , Achaemenids , Macedonians , Mauryas , Kushans , Guptas , and Hindu Shahi . It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time , otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire . Agriculture flourished and trading cities ( such as Multan and Lahore ) grew in wealth .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in Sepphoris , which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews , Christians and pagans . The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs . In the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted . Helios sits in the middle , in his sun chariot , and each zodiac is matched with a Jewish month . Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes , such as the binding of Isaac , as well as traditional rituals , including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta , goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame . A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction , public status and privileges , and could exercise considerable political influence . Upon entering her office , a Vestal was emancipated from her father 's authority . In archaic Roman society , these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man , instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus .
In Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 ( 1968 ) , the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime " to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals , " or " to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches " this theory in any school or university that received public funds . The court 's opinion , written by Justice Abe Fortas , ruled that the Arkansas law violated " the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . The overriding fact is that Arkansas ' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine ; that is , with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group . " The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion , and that " [ T ] he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them . "
The minority leader has a number of formal and informal party responsibilities . Formally , the rules of each party specify certain roles and responsibilities for their leader . For example , under Democratic rules for the 106th Congress , the minority leader may call meetings of the Democratic Caucus . He or she is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ; names the members of the Democratic Leadership Council ; chairs the Policy Committee ; and heads the Steering Committee . Examples of other assignments are making " recommendations to the Speaker on all Democratic Members who shall serve as conferees " and nominating party members to the Committees on Rules and House Administration . Republican rules identify generally comparable functions for their top party leader .
Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada . Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization , more than 4000 years ago . The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa . The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation . The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River . This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan . Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found .

In January 1917 , the Watch Tower Society 's legal representative , Joseph Franklin Rutherford , was elected as its next president . His election was disputed , and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . In this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut .
Since June 2007 , YouTube 's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products . This required YouTube 's content to be transcoded into Apple 's preferred video standard , H.264 , a process that took several months . YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV , iPod Touch and the iPhone . In July 2010 , the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 , avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls . The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform . In September 2012 , YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone , following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system . According to GlobalWebIndex , YouTube was used by 35 % of smartphone users between April and June 2013 , making it the third most used app .
The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples ( such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription ) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters ' territories , and which later became a kingdom . At its zenith ( 95–65 BC ) , the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey , Lebanon , and northern Iran . The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples .
From 1932 , it was taught that the " little flock " of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon . Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144,000 " anointed " who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ , a separate class of members , the " great multitude , " would live in a paradise restored on earth ; from 1935 , new converts to the movement were considered part of that class . By the mid-1930s , the timing of the beginning of Christ 's presence ( Greek : parousía ) , his enthronement as king , and the start of the " last days " were each moved to 1914 .
Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled , working-class , urban culture . Hollywood films such as From This Day Forward ( 1946 ) , set in Highbridge , occasionally delved into Bronx life . Paddy Chayefsky 's Academy Award-winning Marty was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film The Catered Affair , and in the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri film , A Bronx Tale , Spike Lee 's 1999 movie Summer of Sam , centered in an Italian-American Bronx community , 1994 's I Like It Like That that takes place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx , and Doughboys , the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother 's gambling debts .
The Bronx 's evolution from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop was the subject of an award-winning documentary , produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS in 2006 , " From Mambo to Hip Hop : A South Bronx Tale " . Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s . The New York Times has identified 1520 Sedgwick Avenue " an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway " as a starting point , where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community room .

Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
In America , Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement 's seminal influence . In the United Kingdom , Colin Urquhart , Michael Harper , David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments . The Massey conference in New Zealand , 1964 was attended by several Anglicans , including the Rev . Ray Muller , who went on to invite Bennett to New Zealand in 1966 , and played a leading role in developing and promoting the Life in the Spirit seminars . Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky .
In 2014 YouTube said that 300 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute , three times more than one year earlier and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the U.S . The site has 800 million unique users a month . It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 . According to third-party web analytics providers , Alexa and SimilarWeb , YouTube is the third most visited website in the world , as of June 2015 ; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally , attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month .
A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous ; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian . There was also a drop in south polar temperatures ; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period , though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not . These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics , where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers . A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction , one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard . This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation , Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion . These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom . In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Latvia , Estonia and Hungary , it remains one of the most popular religions . Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements , there are only few Protestant adherents ; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs , restrictions during the Communist rule , and also the ongoing secularization . Over the last several decades , religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased . According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer , Protestants made up 12 % of the EU population . According to Pew Research Center , Protestants constituted nearly one fifth ( or 17.8 % ) of the continent 's Christian population in 2010 . Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15 % of all Europeans in 2009 , while Noll claims that less than 12 % of them lived in Europe in 2010 .
Until March 1 , 2009 , the Borough President of the Bronx was Adolfo Carrión Jr. , elected as a Democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy . His successor , Democratic New York State Assembly member Rubén Díaz , Jr. , who won a special election on April 21 , 2009 by a vote of 86.3 % ( 29,420 ) on the " Bronx Unity " line to 13.3 % ( 4,646 ) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the " People First " line , became Borough President on May 1 .
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
As the election approached , other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president . In January 1948 , after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention , Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was " not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office " ; " life-long professional soldiers " , he wrote , " in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason , [ should ] abstain from seeking high political office " . Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time . Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president ; Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the other probable winner , would presumably serve two terms , and Eisenhower , at age 66 in 1956 , would then be too old .
In the course of this religious upheaval , the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 swept through the Bavarian , Thuringian and Swabian principalities . After the Eighty Years ' War in the Low Countries and the French Wars of Religion , the confessional division of the states of the Holy Roman Empire eventually erupted in the Thirty Years ' War between 1618 and 1648 . It devastated much of Germany , killing between 25 % and 40 % of its population . The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , were :
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
The city has a unique status in Brazil , as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other cities in Brazil . The name 'Brasília ' is commonly used as a synonym for the Federal District through synecdoche ; However , the Federal District is composed of 31 administrative regions , only one of which is Brasília proper , with a population of 209,926 in a 2011 survey ; Demographic publications generally do not make this distinction and list the population of Brasília as synonymous with the population of the Federal District , considering the whole of it as its metropolitan area . The city was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Additionally , Brasília hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup .
A series of low-lying annexes ( largely hidden ) flank both ends . Also in the square are the glass-faced Planalto Palace housing the presidential offices , and the Palace of the Supreme Court . Farther east , on a triangle of land jutting into the lake , is the Palace of the Dawn ( Palácio da Alvorada ; the presidential residence ) . Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city 's cathedral , considered by many to be Niemeyer 's finest achievement ( see photographs of the interior ) . The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports , which join in a circle 115 feet ( 35 meters ) above the floor of the nave ; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass . The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways . Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace , Itamaraty Palace , the National Theater , and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture . The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings .
Regardless of the way the tension between universities , individual scientists , and the scientific revolution itself is perceived , there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed . Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction , but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting . The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution , and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation , initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines . Instead of entering higher education to become a " general scholar " immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum , there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself . The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland . The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the west from Alpine , Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County , New Jersey ; the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest ; the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast ; and to the east , Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island . Directly north of the Bronx are ( from west to east ) the adjoining Westchester County communities of Yonkers , Mount Vernon , Pelham Manor and New Rochelle . ( There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough of Manhattan , over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek . Marble Hill 's postal ZIP code , telephonic Area Code and fire service , however , are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan . )
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur . The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space , and only later referred to a building . Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space ; its ancient boundary ( pomerium ) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough ; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state . In Rome , the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra ( Sacred Way ) and the pomerium . Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur , who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before , during and after an act of sacrifice . Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice , errant rites ( vitium ) or an unacceptable plan of action . If an unfavourable sign was given , the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen , consult with his augural colleagues , or abandon the project . Magistrates could use their right of augury ( ius augurum ) to adjourn and overturn the process of law , but were obliged to base their decision on the augur 's observations and advice . For Cicero , himself an augur , this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic . By his time ( mid 1st century BC ) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices , whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum .

A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize . However , as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church , all other sacraments ( except marriage ) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid . Therefore , Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized ( although they are confirmed ) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study .
The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond . Terence , an African and a former slave , was well placed to preach the message of universalism , of the essential unity of the human race , that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks , but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality . The influence of Terence 's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated . Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call :
The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it , due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal . Indeed , Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons , while reducing conventional forces , and with them the overall defense budget , a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2 . This approach became known as the " New Look " , and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953 .
In May 2007 , YouTube launched its Partner Program , a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site . YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program , with 55 percent going to the uploader . There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program . According to TubeMogul , in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube ( one that is shown before the video starts ) cost advertisers on average $ 7.60 per 1000 views . Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement , due to a lack of interested advertisers . Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos , a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $ 7.60 X 55 % = $ 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 .

Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
After a visit to Brasília , the French writer Simone de Beauvoir complained that all of its superquadras exuded " the same air of elegant monotony , " and other observers have equated the city 's large open lawns , plazas , and fields to wastelands . As the city has matured , some of these have gained adornments , and many have been improved by landscaping , giving some observers a sense of " humanized " spaciousness . Although not fully accomplished , the " Brasília utopia " has produced a city of relatively high quality of life , in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure ( the superquadras ) flanked by small commercial areas , bookstores and cafes ; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit .
The Armenian Highland lies in the highlands surrounding Mount Ararat , the highest peak of the region . In the Bronze Age , several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia , including the Hittite Empire ( at the height of its power ) , Mitanni ( South-Western historical Armenia ) , and Hayasa-Azzi ( 1600–1200 BC ) . Soon after Hayasa-Azzi were Arme-Shupria ( 1300s–1190 BC ) , the Nairi ( 1400–1000 BC ) and the Kingdom of Urartu ( 860–590 BC ) , who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland . Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people . Under Ashurbanipal ( 669–627 BC ) , the Assyrian empire reached the Caucasus Mountains ( modern Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan ) .
In the late 1130s , Arnold of Brescia , an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church . After his death , his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists , and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans , though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation . In the early 1170s , Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians . He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church . By 1215 , the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution . Despite that , the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy , as a part of the wider Reformed tradition .
The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip , who is the chief vote counter for his or her party . The current chief deputy majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry . Within the House Republican Conference , the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House Leadership . The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy whips , led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip , which is the highest appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus . The current senior chief deputy minority whip , John Lewis , has held his post since 1991 .
The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the United States , the 15th , but its wide diversity also includes affluent , upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale , Fieldston , Spuyten Duyvil , Schuylerville , Pelham Bay , Pelham Gardens , Morris Park and Country Club . The Bronx , particularly the South Bronx , saw a sharp decline in population , livable housing , and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s , culminating in a wave of arson . Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace in the 1990s into today .
Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by Edward Burne-Jones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome . Another modern mosaic of note is the world 's largest mosaic installation located at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis , located in St. Louis , Missouri . A modern example of mosaic is the Museum of Natural History station of the New York City Subway ( there are many such works of art scattered throughout the New York City subway system , though many IND stations are usually designed with bland mosaics . ) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some Texas interstate highways .
Renaissance humanism was an activity of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors , book collectors , educators , and writers , who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as umanisti – " humanists " . It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries , and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education , which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic . Scholasticism focused on preparing men to be doctors , lawyers or professional theologians , and was taught from approved textbooks in logic , natural philosophy , medicine , law and theology . There were important centres of humanism at Florence , Naples , Rome , Venice , Mantua , Ferrara , and Urbino .
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government , such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates ( 2007 ) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video , with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape . Describing the Arab Spring ( 2010- ) , sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist 's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using " Facebook to schedule the protests , Twitter to coordinate , and YouTube to tell the world . " In 2012 , more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the " Kony 2012 " video was posted to YouTube , with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video " will do more to lead to ( Kony 's ) demise than all other action combined . "
Since then , the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party 's nominee for President , starting with a vote of 2-1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928 , followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt . ( Both had been Governors of New York , but Republican former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey won only 28 % of the Bronx 's vote in 1948 against 55 % for Pres . Harry Truman , the winning Democrat , and 17 % for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives . It was only 32 years earlier , by contrast , that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency , Charles Evans Hughes , had won 42.6 % of the Bronx 's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson 's 49.8 % and Socialist candidate Allan Benson 's 7.3 % . )
Police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention . This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead , especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict ( Goldsmith and Sheptycki , 2007 ) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions ( Hills , 2009 ) .
By contrast , Tom Wolfe 's Bonfire of the Vanities ( 1987 ) portrays a wealthy , white protagonist , Sherman McCoy , getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals . A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse . However , times change , and in 2007 , the New York Times reported that " the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman 's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments . " In the same article , the Reverend Al Sharpton ( whose fictional analogue in the novel is " Reverend Bacon " ) asserts that " twenty years later , the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe 's wardrobe . "
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .
Others , such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . However , the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
On December 20 , 2005 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed , because the purpose of the display ( educating the public on American legal traditions ) was secular in nature . In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3 , 2006 , however , a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed .
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
Although the Reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . Since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most Protestant churches .
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean . In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean , the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the Proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . Roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , 600–540 Ma .
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime-free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .
Much of YouTube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . In 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . In May 2013 , Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . In February 2015 , Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation . Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ : " As a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , O God . " Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened .
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways ' in his honor . It was inspired in part by Eisenhower 's own Army experiences in World War II , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . Commemorative signs reading " Eisenhower Interstate System " and bearing Eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System . Several highways are also named for him , including the Eisenhower Expressway ( Interstate 290 ) near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver .
Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science ( see the history of science in the Renaissance ) . This was despite what A. C. Crombie ( viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress ) calls " a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity " , in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world . But Renaissance humanists , who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity , had no interest in scientific innovation . However , by the mid-to-late 16th century , even the universities , though still dominated by Scholasticism , began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology , thus setting the stage for Galileo 's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism .
The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism , but in 380 under Theodosius I , Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire . Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus ( d. 402 ) were rejected . Christianity became increasingly popular . Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution , but Rome 's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms , and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions .
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries , including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal . Nepal 's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions , Hinduism and Buddhhism . These are amply reflected in the many temples , shrines , stupas , monasteries , and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur . The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day , including archeological exportation .
The First Great Awakening was an evangelical and revitalization movement that swept through Protestant Europe and British America , especially the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s , leaving a permanent impact on American Protestantism . It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ . Pulling away from ritual , ceremony , sacramentalism and hierarchy , it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption , and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality .
The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in Sepphoris , which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews , Christians and pagans . The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs . In the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted . Helios sits in the middle , in his sun chariot , and each zodiac is matched with a Jewish month . Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes , such as the binding of Isaac , as well as traditional rituals , including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains .
The Cathedral of Brasília in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil , is an expression of the architect Oscar Niemeyer . This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure , seems with its glass roof reaching up , open , to the heavens . On 31 May 1970 , the Cathedral’s structure was finished , and only the 70 m ( 229.66 ft ) diameter of the circular area were visible . Niemeyer 's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric . The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns . These columns , having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t , represent two hands moving upwards to heaven . The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970 .
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends . According to Swayambhu Purana , present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake names " Nagdaha " as it was full of snakes . The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa Manjusri with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land . After sometimes , a demon named Banasur closed the outlet and the valley was again a lake . Then lots Krishna came to Nepal , killed Banasur and again drained out water . He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
Beginning in first decade of the 15th century , Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest , Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe 's writings , founded the Hussite movement . He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination . He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance , Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . After his execution , a revolt erupted . Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope .
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003–04 . This fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . In view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in Kathmandu are mainly by road and air . Kathmandu is connected by the Tribhuvan Highway to the south , Prithvi Highway to the west and Araniko Highway to the north . The BP Highway , connecting Kathmandu to the eastern part of Nepal is under construction .
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as : Bhavani , Durga , Gaja-Lakshmi , Hariti-Sitala , Mahsishamardini , Saptamatrika ( seven mother goddesses ) , and Sri-Lakshmi ( wealth-goddess ) . From the 3rd century BC , apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses , Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period ( it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC ) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular . These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution : the Licchavi or classical period ( 500 to 900 AD ) , the post-classical period ( 1000 to 1400 AD ) , with strong influence of the Palla art form ; the Malla period ( 1400 onwards ) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology .
Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of " separation of church and state " , or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment . Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution , while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified . These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers . Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts , and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence , which references the idea of a " Creator " and " Nature 's God " , though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a " Creator " or " Nature 's God . "
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries , most notably with Nicolas Delamare 's Traité de la Police ( " Treatise on the Police " ) , first published in 1705 . The German Polizeiwissenschaft ( Science of Police ) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police . Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften ( 1937 ) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however , this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault 's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850 .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
In the United States , their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties . Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference , the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service , the right of patients to refuse medical treatment , and the right to engage in public discourse . Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada .
An exceptionally well preserved , carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany , the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390 . Because of its purely geometrical pattern , the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas , especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem . A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor .
Regardless of the way the tension between universities , individual scientists , and the scientific revolution itself is perceived , there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed . Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction , but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting . The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution , and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation , initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines . Instead of entering higher education to become a " general scholar " immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum , there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself . The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge .
Serological methods are highly sensitive , specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms . These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen . The antigen , usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent , is bound by the antibody . This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways , dependent upon the test . For example , " Strep throat " is often diagnosed within minutes , and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent , S. pyogenes , that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab . Serological tests , if available , are usually the preferred route of identification , however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration . Some serological methods are extremely costly , although when commonly used , such as with the " strep test " , they can be inexpensive .
Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that Christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . The national motto " In God We Trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . A circuit court ruling affirmed Ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible , " With God , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
6th-century BCE pre-Socratic Greek philosophers Thales of Miletus and Xenophanes of Colophon were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition , thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists . Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe . These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm . Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens . Pericles , the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras . Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include Protagoras ( like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles ) , known for his famous dictum " man is the measure of all things " and Democritus , who proposed that matter was composed of atoms . Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers , principally Plato and Aristotle . The historian Thucydides , noted for his scientific and rational approach to history , is also much admired by later humanists . In the 3rd century BCE , Epicurus became known for his concise phrasing of the problem of evil , lack of belief in the afterlife , and human-centred approaches to achieving eudaimonia . He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule .
A loblolly pine , known as the " Eisenhower Pine " , was located on Augusta 's 17th hole , approximately 210 yards ( 192 m ) from the Masters tee . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , an Augusta National member , hit the tree so many times that , at a 1956 club meeting , he proposed that it be cut down . Not wanting to offend the president , the club 's chairman , Clifford Roberts , immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request . The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage .
The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma . During the Silurian , Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation . The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Rheic Ocean , a seaway of Iapetus Ocean ( now in between Avalonia and Laurentia ) , and newly formed Ural Ocean .
In some countries , YouTube is completely blocked , either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest , the run-up to an election , or in response to upcoming political anniversaries . In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open , but access to specific videos is blocked . In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video , YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , in what the leadership calls a " theocratic organization " , reflecting their belief that it is God 's " visible organization " on earth . The organization is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size , but since early 2014 has comprised seven members , [ note 1 ] all of whom profess to be of the " anointed " class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the Watch Tower Society 's Brooklyn headquarters . There is no election for membership ; new members are selected by the existing body . Until late 2012 , the Governing Body described itself as the representative and " spokesman " for God 's " faithful and discreet slave class " ( approximately 10,000 self-professed " anointed " Jehovah 's Witnesses ) . At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society , the " faithful and discreet slave " was defined as referring to the Governing Body only . The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions , including publishing , assembly programs and evangelizing activities . It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers , after they have been recommended by local branches , with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions . Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants , and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief .
The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85 . The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . They were laid down in the Umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .
Beginning in first decade of the 15th century , Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest , Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe 's writings , founded the Hussite movement . He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination . He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance , Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . After his execution , a revolt erupted . Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute , in the form of the Heinrich Heine Memorial , better known as the Lorelei Fountain from one of Heine 's best-known works ( 1838 ) . After Heine 's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected , allegedly for anti-Semitic motives , a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet ( 1797–1856 ) , his incensed German-American admirers , including Carl Schurz , started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan , at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street . However , this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism , aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art .
When the U.S. entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth , Kansas . In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers . His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps , where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army . He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command – at the site of " Pickett 's Charge " on the Gettysburg , Pennsylvania Civil War battleground . Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat , he displayed excellent organizational skills , as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers ' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel .
In 1957 , the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision . Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order . When Faubus balked , the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division . They escorted and protected nine black students ' entry to Little Rock Central High School , an all-white public school , for the first time since the Reconstruction Era . Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions , writing " The overwhelming majority of southerners , Negro and white , stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock " .
In the early stages of the First Punic War ( 264 BC ) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat . The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . Even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower 's combat command skills ; during the initial phase of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's move into the Kasserine Pass , Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates . He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall , commanding U.S. II Corps . He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns . In February 1943 , his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery . The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign . Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA .
Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . The agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping . With 18 million international tourists in 2013 , Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world . The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world , with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Renaissance humanism was an activity of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors , book collectors , educators , and writers , who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as umanisti – " humanists " . It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries , and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education , which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic . Scholasticism focused on preparing men to be doctors , lawyers or professional theologians , and was taught from approved textbooks in logic , natural philosophy , medicine , law and theology . There were important centres of humanism at Florence , Naples , Rome , Venice , Mantua , Ferrara , and Urbino .
Greece 's rail network is estimated to be at 2,548 km . Rail transport in Greece is operated by TrainOSE , a subsidiary of the Hellenic Railways Organization ( OSE ) . Most of the country 's network is standard gauge ( 1,565 km ) , while the country also has 983 km of narrow gauge . A total of 764 km of rail are electrified . Greece has rail connections with Bulgaria , the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey . A total of three suburban railway systems ( Proastiakos ) are in operation ( in Athens , Thessaloniki and Patras ) , while one metro system is operational in Athens with another under construction .
Protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . In the nineteenth century , throughout the Anglo-American world , numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . As an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . To Bismarck this was " practical Christianity " . These programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the Western world .
The Portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum . The city has six international schools : American School of Brasília , Brasília International School ( BIS ) , Escola das Nações , Swiss International School ( SIS ) , Lycée français François-Mitterrand ( LfFM ) and Maple Bear Canadian School . August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - The British School of Brasilia . Brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ—as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty . A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064 . They settled in large numbers in Cilicia , an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times . In 1080 , they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia , which became the focus of Armenian nationalism . The Armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby Crusader States , but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions . In the next few centuries , Djenghis Khan , Timurids , and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians .
Devise Minority Party Strategies . The minority leader , in consultation with other party colleagues , has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives . The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances , such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party . For instance , a majority party riven by internal dissension , as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and " regular " Republicans were at loggerheads , may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion . Among the variable strategies available to the minority party , which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process , are the following :
The Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century . One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist . Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation , which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body , blood , soul , and divinity of Christ . They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion .
The Armenian Highland lies in the highlands surrounding Mount Ararat , the highest peak of the region . In the Bronze Age , several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia , including the Hittite Empire ( at the height of its power ) , Mitanni ( South-Western historical Armenia ) , and Hayasa-Azzi ( 1600–1200 BC ) . Soon after Hayasa-Azzi were Arme-Shupria ( 1300s–1190 BC ) , the Nairi ( 1400–1000 BC ) and the Kingdom of Urartu ( 860–590 BC ) , who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland . Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people . Under Ashurbanipal ( 669–627 BC ) , the Assyrian empire reached the Caucasus Mountains ( modern Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan ) .
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park , which includes Orchard Beach—and the fourth largest , Van Cortlandt Park , which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers . Also in the northern Bronx , Wave Hill , the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house , gardens , changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale . Nearer the borough 's center , and along the Bronx River , is Bronx Park ; its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens , which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire county , and its southern end the Bronx Zoo , the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States . Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir , surrounded by 2 miles ( 3 km ) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood ; the reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack . Further south is Crotona Park , home to a 3.3-acre ( 1.3 ha ) lake , 28 species of trees , and a large swimming pool . The land for these parks , and many others , was bought by New York City in 1888 , while land was still open and inexpensive , in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development .
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
They can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as Brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . A " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in South Africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
Valerian 's first religious edict singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult , outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome 's traditional gods . His second edict acknowledged a Christian threat to the Imperial system – not yet at its heart but close to it , among Rome’s equites and Senators . Christian apologists interpreted his disgraceful capture and death as divine judgement . The next forty years were peaceful ; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile , due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence . Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius ' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a “pagan” basis in Christian heresies . The Christian churches were disunited ; Paul of Samosata , Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 for " dogmatic reasons – his doctrine on the human nature of Christ was rejected – and for his lifestyle , which reminded his brethren of the habits of the administrative elite " . The reasons for his deposition were widely circulated among the churches . Meanwhile , Aurelian ( 270-75 ) appealed for harmony among his soldiers ( concordia militum ) , stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official , Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome 's Campus Martius .
Between 2005 and 2011 , Greece has had the highest percentage increase in industrial output compared to 2005 levels out of all European Union members , with an increase of 6 % . Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010 , with domestic output decreasing by 5.8 % and industrial production in general by 13.4 % . Currently , Greece is ranked third in the European Union in the production of marble ( over 920,000 tons ) , after Italy and Spain .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
Armenians constitute the main population of Armenia and the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic . There is a wide-ranging diaspora of around 5 million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside of modern Armenia . The largest Armenian populations today exist in Russia , the United States , France , Georgia , Iran , Ukraine , Lebanon , and Syria . With the exceptions of Iran and the former Soviet states , the present-day Armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the Armenian Genocide .
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine 's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt . Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine 's Monastery is exceptional . On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background . In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background . The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets , and two contemporary figure , " Abbot Longinos " and " John the Deacon " . The mosaic was probably created in 565/6 .
Officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " The practice was a mark of the " Other " , attributed to Rome 's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls . Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain . Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere .
Dwight David " Ike " Eisenhower ( /ˈaɪzənˌhaʊ.ər/ EYE-zən-HOW-ər ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was an American politician and general who served as the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 . He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe . He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front . In 1951 , he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO .
The apse mosaic of the Gelati Monastery is a rare example of mosaic use in Georgia . Began by king David IV and completed by his son Demetrius I of Georgia , the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels . The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids . The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople . Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other , lesser known sites . The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes . In Tsromi the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme . Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text .
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . An example is the Academy of European Law , which offers training in European law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . EUCLID ( Pôle Universitaire Euclide , Euclid University ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations , its peoples and member states . The European University Institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the European Union .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .
Within the diasporan Armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of Armenians . For example , Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as Parskahay ( Պարսկահայ ) , while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as Lipananahay ( Լիբանանահայ ) . Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language . This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine , Russia , and Georgia ( where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province ) . In diverse communities ( such as in Canada and the U.S. ) where many different kinds of Armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
Like other neighborhoods in New York City , the South Bronx has no official boundaries . The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham Road was often used as a northern limit . The Bronx River more consistently forms an eastern boundary . The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi-unit homes . The South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse , Borough Hall , and other government buildings , as well as Yankee Stadium . The Cross Bronx Expressway bisects it , east to west . The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
Until March 1 , 2009 , the Borough President of the Bronx was Adolfo Carrión Jr. , elected as a Democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy . His successor , Democratic New York State Assembly member Rubén Díaz , Jr. , who won a special election on April 21 , 2009 by a vote of 86.3 % ( 29,420 ) on the " Bronx Unity " line to 13.3 % ( 4,646 ) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the " People First " line , became Borough President on May 1 .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
Kathmandu Metropolitan City ( KMC ) , in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat ( IRC ) . KMC 's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene , Oregon , United States . This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities : Motsumoto City of Japan , Rochester of the USA , Yangon ( formerly Rangoon ) of Myanmar , Xi'an of the People 's Republic of China , Minsk of Belarus , and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea . KMC 's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries , other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu .
The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples ( such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription ) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters ' territories , and which later became a kingdom . At its zenith ( 95–65 BC ) , the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey , Lebanon , and northern Iran . The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples .
Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal , displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists . Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts . Art in Kathmandu is vibrant , demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art , derived from a great number of national , Asian , and global influences . Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas : the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet , closely linked to the country 's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting , including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for . Internationally , the British-based charity , the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu .
Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " I give that you might give . " Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . For example , humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma . During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana . Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and , as the period progressed , drifted toward the South Pole . Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents ( since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier ) , but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period , causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them . Also , Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia . The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this . By the end of the period , Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated .
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible , education on all levels got a strong boost . By the middle of the eighteenth century , the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent , in Scotland 65 per cent , and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write . Colleges and universities were founded . For example , the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later . About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century , including Yale ( 1701 ) . Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning .
Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower 's combat command skills ; during the initial phase of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's move into the Kasserine Pass , Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates . He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall , commanding U.S. II Corps . He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns . In February 1943 , his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery . The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign . Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA .
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .
With high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . Rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( CAD ) software can be assembled by a robot . Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . But these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . With robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
As a consequence of his heart attack , Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm , which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25 , 1957 . This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand . The stroke had caused an aphasia . The president also suffered from Crohn 's disease , chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine , which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9 , 1956 . To treat the intestinal block , surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine . His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis . Eisenhower 's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits , but he still indulged in alcohol . During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29 , 1959 ; however , before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower " drank several gin-and-tonics , and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner " .
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . By 1992 , with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe ( Joubert and Bevers , 1996 ) .

From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma . During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana . Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and , as the period progressed , drifted toward the South Pole . Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents ( since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier ) , but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period , causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them . Also , Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia . The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this . By the end of the period , Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated .
From 1932 , it was taught that the " little flock " of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon . Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144,000 " anointed " who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ , a separate class of members , the " great multitude , " would live in a paradise restored on earth ; from 1935 , new converts to the movement were considered part of that class . By the mid-1930s , the timing of the beginning of Christ 's presence ( Greek : parousía ) , his enthronement as king , and the start of the " last days " were each moved to 1914 .
The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago . Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the Holocene . In addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene , and are still rising today . The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea . Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont , Quebec , Ontario and Michigan . Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin . Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea , including much of Finland . The region continues to rise , still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe . The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger , immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase , to near its present boundaries .
The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century , beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity , and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia . The early churches were mostly simple basilicas , but some with side apses . By the fifth century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used . By the seventh century , centrally planned churches had been built and a more complicated niched buttress and radiating Hrip'simé style had formed . By the time of the Arab invasion , most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
The economic output of the metropolitan area alone is worth more than one third of national GDP around $ 6.5billion in terms of nominal GDP NR.s 550 billion approximately per year $ 2200 per capital income approx three times national average . Kathmandu exports handicrafts , artworks , garments , carpets , pashmina , paper ; trade accounts for 21 % of its finances. [ which ? ] Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19 % of the revenue that Kathmandu generates . Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products . Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture ( 9 % ) , education ( 6 % ) , transport ( 6 % ) , and hotels and restaurants ( 5 % ) . Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls .
A pater familias was the senior priest of his household . He offered daily cult to his lares and penates , and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth . His wife ( mater familias ) was responsible for the household 's cult to Vesta . In rural estates , bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines ( lararia ) and their deities . Household cults had state counterparts . In Vergil 's Aeneid , Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the lares and penates from Troy , along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta .
All Protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the Church universal and generally deny the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . The various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the Bible alone ( rather than with Catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The " Five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of the day .
The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople . Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels , the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia . They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites . The esonarthex has two fluted domes , specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ . The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos . The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban , offering the model of the church to Christ . The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ . These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings , landscapes , figures .
Multiracial Americans are also a sizable minority in the Bronx . People of multiracial heritage number over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0 % of the population .

People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1 % of the population . People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1 % of the population .
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "
As a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece 's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country 's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7 % in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) . In order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries , and the IMF , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling €110 billion . In order to secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control . Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .
In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data , Arno Tausch ( Corvinus University of Budapest ) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism . The Global Value Development Index , calculated by Tausch , relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law , no support for shadow economy , postmaterial activism , support for democracy , a non-acceptance of violence , xenophobia and racism , trust in transnational capital and Universities , confidence in the market economy , supporting gender justice , and engaging in environmental activism , etc .
Protestantism spread in Europe during the 16th century . Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] Denmark , [ d ] Norway , [ e ] Sweden , [ f ] Finland , [ g ] Prussia , [ h ] Latvia , [ i ] , Estonia , [ j ] and Iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] Hungary , [ m ] the Netherlands , [ n ] Scotland , [ o ] Switzerland , [ p ] and France [ q ] by such reformers as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . Arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany . In 1534 , King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England [ s ] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of Edward VI , through Thomas Cranmer , Richard Hooker , Matthew Parker and other theologians . There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist , Moravian , and other Pietistic movements . In later centuries , Protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing . Following the airport 's master plan , Infraero built a second runway , which was finished in 2006 . In 2007 , the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers . The main building 's third floor , with 12 thousand square meters , has a panoramic deck , a food court , shops , four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people , and space for exhibitions . Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces . The airport is located about 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) from the central area of Brasília , outside the metro system . The area outside the airport 's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília 's central district . The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars . The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines ( TAM , GOL , Azul , WebJET , Trip and Avianca ) , in addition to a number of international carriers . In 2012 , Brasília 's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium , formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company , with a 50 % stake each . During the 25-year concession , the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year .
Witnesses believe that a " little flock " go to heaven , but that the hope for life after death for the majority of " other sheep " involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon . They interpret Revelation 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000 , who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth . Jehovah 's Witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon , but that God is the final judge . During Christ 's millennial reign , most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever ; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium .
YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos , and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface . A small number of videos , such as the weekly addresses by President Barack Obama , can be downloaded as MP4 files . Numerous third-party web sites , applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos . In February 2009 , YouTube announced a test service , allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout . In June 2012 , Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos . In response , Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site . The default settings when uploading a video to YouTube will retain a copyright on the video for the uploader , but since July 2012 it has been possible to select a Creative Commons license as the default , allowing other users to reuse and remix the material if it is free of copyright .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas , although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers , rather than the madrasa itself , granted the license or degree . Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Hossein Nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval Islamic madrasahs became universities . George Makdisi and others , however , argue that the European university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world . Other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics .

Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
When the White House is controlled by the House majority party , then the House minority leader assumes a larger role in formulating alternatives to executive branch initiatives and in acting as a national spokesperson for his or her party . " As Minority Leader during [ President Lyndon Johnson 's ] Democratic administration , my responsibility has been to propose Republican alternatives , " said Minority Leader Gerald Ford , R-MI . Greatly outnumbered in the House , Minority Leader Ford devised a political strategy that allowed Republicans to offer their alternatives in a manner that provided them political protection . As Ford explained :
The Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056 . The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived ( Theotokos with raised hands , four evangelists with seraphim , scenes from Christ 's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos ) . In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures , detail , landscape and setting .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson ( later U.S. president ) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House , both from Texas . Joe Martin , the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that Eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . There were exceptions , Leonard W. Hall , for example , who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . However , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 . In November 2006 , it was bought by Google for US $ 1.65 billion . YouTube now operates as one of Google 's subsidiaries . The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
Portuguese pavement ( in Portuguese , Calçada Portuguesa ) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal , and common throughout the Lusosphere . Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex , it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design . In Portuguese-speaking countries , many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even , though far more occasionally , streets done in this mosaic form . Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style .
Jeffries and Ryan ( 2001 ) argue that the modern concept of separation of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court . The central point , they argue , was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools , followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education . Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty-five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand-year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid-1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s .
In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier . Traditionally , these festivals were celebrated by Newars . In recent years , these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well . As the capital of the Republic of Nepal , various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu . With mass migration to the city , the cultures of Khas from the west , Kirats from the east , Bon/Tibetan from the north , and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously . The festivities such as the Ghode ( horse ) Jatra , Indra Jatra , Dashain Durga Puja festivals , Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm . Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics . These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings , as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . Practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . In 2003 , Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship , one of the categories of free flying . In August 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship .
Football and Cricket are the most popular sports among the younger generation in Nepal and there are several stadiums in the city . The sport is governed by the All Nepal Football Association ( ANFA ) from its headquarters in Kathmandu . The only international football stadium in the city is the Dasarath Rangasala Stadium , a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for football matches and cultural events , located in the neighborhood of Tripureshwor . It is the largest stadium in Nepal with a capacity of 25,000 spectators , built in 1956 . Martyr 's Memorial League is also held in this ground every year . The stadium was renovated with Chinese help before the 8th South Asian Games were held in Kathmandu and had floodlights installed . Kathmandu is home to the oldest football clubs of Nepal such as RCT , Sankata and NRT . Other prominent clubs include MMC , Machhindra FC , Tribhuwan Army Club ( TAC ) and MPC .
The synagogue in Eshtemoa ( As-Samu ) was built around the 4th century . The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns . The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya ( excavated in 1971–72 , founded in the end of the 4th century ) has three mosaic panels , the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine , two menorahs , a lulav and an etrog with columns , deer and rams . The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion’s den . The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels . The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center . It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
In the 6th century BCE , Taoist teacher Lao Tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . The Silver Rule of Confucianism from Analects XV.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . Humanistic thought is also contained in other Confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in Zuo Zhuan , Ji Liang says , " People is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . So , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; Neishi Guo says , " Gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " Taoist and Confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in Sepphoris , which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews , Christians and pagans . The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs . In the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted . Helios sits in the middle , in his sun chariot , and each zodiac is matched with a Jewish month . Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes , such as the binding of Isaac , as well as traditional rituals , including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains .
Dwight David " Ike " Eisenhower ( /ˈaɪzənˌhaʊ.ər/ EYE-zən-HOW-ər ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was an American politician and general who served as the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 . He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe . He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front . In 1951 , he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO .
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening . The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it , and miraculously recovered , though he had to repeat his freshman year . He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college , though they lacked the funds . They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions .
In the judgment of political scientist Randall Ripley , since 1883 " the candidate for Speaker nominated by the minority party has clearly been the Minority Leader . " However , this assertion is subject to dispute . On December 3 , 1883 , the House elected Democrat John G. Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker . Republicans placed in nomination for the speakership J. Warren Keifer of Ohio , who was Speaker the previous Congress . Clearly , Keifer was not the Republicans ' minority leader . He was a discredited leader in part because as Speaker he arbitrarily handed out " choice jobs to close relatives ... all at handsome salaries . " Keifer received " the empty honor of the minority nomination . But with it came a sting -- for while this naturally involves the floor leadership , he was deserted by his [ partisan ] associates and his career as a national figure terminated ingloriously . " Representative Thomas Reed , R-ME , who later became Speaker , assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in Keifer 's stead . " [ A ] lthough Keifer was the minority 's candidate for Speaker , Reed became its acknowledged leader , and ever after , so long as he served in the House , remained the most conspicuous member of his party .
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
In the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times , notably in 139 BC and 33 BC . In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " Egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19 . Despite several Imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . In the late 1st century AD , Tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at Rome " .
Eisenhower , as well as the officers and troops under him , had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations , and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault . His first struggles , however , were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion ; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord . Admiral Ernest J . King fought with Eisenhower over King 's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific . He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord , to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented , as he did . Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter 's concern with civilian casualties ; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans , and Eisenhower prevailed . He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton , by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate , and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy .
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
Kathmandu ( /ˌkɑːtmɑːnˈduː/ ; Nepali pronunciation : [ kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu ] ) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal . It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar ( Metropolitan City ) , as compared to Upa-Mahanagar ( Sub-Metropolitan City ) or Nagar ( City ) . Kathmandu is the core of Nepal 's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi , Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities . Kathmandu is also known informally as " KTM " or the " tri-city " . According to the 2011 census , Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures 49.45 km2 ( 19.09 sq mi ) .

Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
With the abatement of persecution , St. Jerome acknowledged the Empire as a bulwark against evil but insisted that " imperial honours " were contrary to Christian teaching . His was an authoritative but minority voice : most Christians showed no qualms in the veneration of even " pagan " emperors . The peace of the emperors was the peace of God ; as far as the Church was concerned , internal dissent and doctrinal schism were a far greater problem . The solution came from a hitherto unlikely source : as pontifex maximus Constantine I favoured the " Catholic Church of the Christians " against the Donatists because :
The spread of Greek literature , mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome 's festivals and rituals , and the embellishment of its mythology . Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus , who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals . In the last century of the Republic , Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite , most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods ; notably , Scaevola and the polymath Varro . For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus ' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction ; what the people believed was not itself the truth , but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with . Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives , the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals , and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold . Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus . Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths . In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .
During the Early Modern period ( approximately late 15th century to 1800 ) , the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth , productivity and innovative research . At the end of the Middle Ages , about 400 years after the first university was founded , there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe . In the 15th century , twenty-eight new ones were created , with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625 . This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe , with the highest concentrations in the German Empire ( 34 ) , Italian countries ( 26 ) , France ( 25 ) , and Spain ( 23 ) – this was close to a 500 % increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages . This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared , or institutions that merged with other universities during this time . It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period , as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions . In fact , the term " university " was not always used to designate a higher education institution . In Mediterranean countries , the term studium generale was still often used , while " Academy " was common in Northern European countries .
All police officers in the United Kingdom , whatever their actual rank , are 'constables ' in terms of their legal position . This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner . However , certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations , such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect 's house ( section 18 PACE in England and Wales ) by an officer of the rank of Inspector , or the power to authorize a suspect 's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent .
The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva ( Pashupati ) . Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu , Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu . It served as the seat of national deity , Lord Pashupatinath , until Nepal was secularized . However , a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior . The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century , although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old . The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Shivaratri , or the night of Lord Shiva , is the most important festival that takes place here , attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus .

The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily . The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina . The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor . Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . An example is the Academy of European Law , which offers training in European law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . EUCLID ( Pôle Universitaire Euclide , Euclid University ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations , its peoples and member states . The European University Institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the European Union .
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
At the end of May 1942 , Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold , commanding general of the Army Air Forces , to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England , Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney . He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment , stating he had an " uneasy feeling " about Chaney and his staff . On June 23 , 1942 , he returned to London as Commanding General , European Theater of Operations ( ETOUSA ) , based in London and with a house on Coombe , Kingston upon Thames , and replaced Chaney . He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7 .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
In 1566 , the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited . By the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . On July 9 , 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order . In 1808 , the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil , because of the French invasion of Portugal . King João VI established the " Intendência Geral de Polícia " ( General Police Intendancy ) for investigations . He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809 . In 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra , composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran . Zarathustra 's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda ( God in the form of supreme wisdom ) . The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices , made freely in this present life , in the afterlife . The importance placed on thought , action , responsibility , and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by , and inspired a number of , Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu .
IMF 's forecast said that Greece 's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014 . But in fact , the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployemnt . The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009 , and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013 . In 2015 , Greece 's jobless rate is around 24 per cent . It is thought that Greece 's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing . Following the airport 's master plan , Infraero built a second runway , which was finished in 2006 . In 2007 , the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers . The main building 's third floor , with 12 thousand square meters , has a panoramic deck , a food court , shops , four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people , and space for exhibitions . Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces . The airport is located about 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) from the central area of Brasília , outside the metro system . The area outside the airport 's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília 's central district . The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars . The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines ( TAM , GOL , Azul , WebJET , Trip and Avianca ) , in addition to a number of international carriers . In 2012 , Brasília 's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium , formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company , with a 50 % stake each . During the 25-year concession , the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
In 1953 , the Republican Party 's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch ; however , the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point . At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower 's presidency .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
Historians trace the earliest church labeled Baptist back to 1609 in Amsterdam , with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the mid-18th century , the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South . The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership , as did the preachers ' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery , which had been part of the 18th-century teachings . Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent .
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
The economic output of the metropolitan area alone is worth more than one third of national GDP around $ 6.5billion in terms of nominal GDP NR.s 550 billion approximately per year $ 2200 per capital income approx three times national average . Kathmandu exports handicrafts , artworks , garments , carpets , pashmina , paper ; trade accounts for 21 % of its finances. [ which ? ] Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19 % of the revenue that Kathmandu generates . Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products . Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture ( 9 % ) , education ( 6 % ) , transport ( 6 % ) , and hotels and restaurants ( 5 % ) . Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls .

A pater familias was the senior priest of his household . He offered daily cult to his lares and penates , and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth . His wife ( mater familias ) was responsible for the household 's cult to Vesta . In rural estates , bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines ( lararia ) and their deities . Household cults had state counterparts . In Vergil 's Aeneid , Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the lares and penates from Troy , along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta .
Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors : the Central Sector , the East Sector , the North Sector , the City Core and the West Sector . For civic administration , the city is further divided into 35 administrative wards . The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members . It holds biannual meetings to review , process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions . The ward 's profile documents for the 35 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population , the structure and condition of houses , the type of roads , educational , health and financial institutions , entertainment facilities , parking space , security provisions , etc . It also includes lists of development projects completed , on-going and planned , along with informative data about the cultural heritage , festivals , historical sites and the local inhabitants . Ward 16 is the largest , with an area of 437.4 ha ; ward 26 is the smallest , with an area of 4 ha .
The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza . In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus , identified by his name in Hebrew letters . Near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . The floor was paved in 508/509 . It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon ( Menois ) and the Christian church at Shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up , as Europe , Greenland and North America drifted apart . In western North America , mountain building started in the Eocene , and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts . In Europe , the Tethys Sea finally vanished , while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant , the Mediterranean , and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north . Though the North Atlantic was opening , a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia , creating the Himalayan orogeny .
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots . Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva . He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there . Despite heavy persecution , the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment . French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character , made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s . This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts , known as the French Wars of Religion . The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559 . Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time , illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of August 1572 , when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France . The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes , promising official toleration of the Protestant minority , but under highly restricted conditions . Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion , and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century , culminating in Louis XIV 's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again . In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau , Frederick William I , Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam , giving free passage to Huguenot refugees . In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England , the Netherlands , Prussia , Switzerland , and the English and Dutch overseas colonies . A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region .
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) , law , grammar and rhetoric . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum , while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship . The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs can not be underestimated . Once humanist professors joined the university faculty , they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction , to translate and interpret classical texts , and to live honorable lives . Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts , as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts . Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno , Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts . The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship . For instance , Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen , whose ideas he verified through his own dissections . In law , Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective , while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist . Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts , which was important for the reform at Protestant universities . Galileo Galilei , who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua , and Martin Luther , who taught at the University of Wittenberg ( as did Melanchthon ) , also had humanist training . The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university ; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs , syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship .
Throughout his presidency , Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism . A self-described " progressive conservative , " he continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation , especially Social Security . He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers . He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years , which had not been completed under Truman .
In the following century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art ( see details in Ravenna section ) . Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century . In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo , mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah ; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors , naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion . The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio , which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century , although it was restored many times later . The baptistery of the basilica , which was demolished in the 15th century , had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae , large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated . In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro , now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio , every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century . Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome , while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background . The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists .
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian 's reign . The figures , animals , plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background . The portrait of a moustached man , probably a Gothic chieftain , is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age . The so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II 's reign around 565–577 . Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room . The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition . There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki ( 5th–6th centuries ) .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , in what the leadership calls a " theocratic organization " , reflecting their belief that it is God 's " visible organization " on earth . The organization is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size , but since early 2014 has comprised seven members , [ note 1 ] all of whom profess to be of the " anointed " class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the Watch Tower Society 's Brooklyn headquarters . There is no election for membership ; new members are selected by the existing body . Until late 2012 , the Governing Body described itself as the representative and " spokesman " for God 's " faithful and discreet slave class " ( approximately 10,000 self-professed " anointed " Jehovah 's Witnesses ) . At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society , the " faithful and discreet slave " was defined as referring to the Governing Body only . The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions , including publishing , assembly programs and evangelizing activities . It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers , after they have been recommended by local branches , with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions . Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants , and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief .
The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower 's resignation in December 1950 , when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe . Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31 , 1952 , and he resumed his presidency of Columbia . He held this position until January 20 , 1953 , when he became the President of the United States .
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy . Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent . Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments , such as the compound light microscope , or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope . Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification . Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen . A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells . This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases , where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament . The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections . In talks located in London that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower , when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections . In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria , and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S. , U.K. and France . At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called " Open Skies " to facilitate disarmament , which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other 's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
The minority leader has a number of formal and informal party responsibilities . Formally , the rules of each party specify certain roles and responsibilities for their leader . For example , under Democratic rules for the 106th Congress , the minority leader may call meetings of the Democratic Caucus . He or she is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ; names the members of the Democratic Leadership Council ; chairs the Policy Committee ; and heads the Steering Committee . Examples of other assignments are making " recommendations to the Speaker on all Democratic Members who shall serve as conferees " and nominating party members to the Committees on Rules and House Administration . Republican rules identify generally comparable functions for their top party leader .
After fourteen consecutive years of economic growth , Greece went into recession in 2008 . By the end of 2009 , the Greek economy faced the highest budget deficit and government debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU . After several upward revisions , the 2009 budget deficit is now estimated at 15.7 % of GDP . This , combined with rapidly rising debt levels ( 127.9 % of GDP in 2009 ) led to a precipitous increase in borrowing costs , effectively shutting Greece out of the global financial markets and resulting in a severe economic crisis .
A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
A party 's floor leader , in conjunction with other party leaders , plays an influential role in the formulation of party policy and programs . He is instrumental in guiding legislation favored by his party through the House , or in resisting those programs of the other party that are considered undesirable by his own party . He is instrumental in devising and implementing his party 's strategy on the floor with respect to promoting or opposing legislation . He is kept constantly informed as to the status of legislative business and as to the sentiment of his party respecting particular legislation under consideration . Such information is derived in part from the floor leader 's contacts with his party 's members serving on House committees , and with the members of the party 's whip organization .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft , according to Foucault the police had an administrative , economic and social duty ( " procuring abundance " ) . It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d'état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population ( and unwittingly supervising the population ) , which , according to mercantilist theory , was to be the main strength of the state . Thus , its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns , urban planning ( which was important because of the miasma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . ) , and surveillance of prices .
On May 1 , 1960 , a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over Soviet Union airspace . The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an East–West summit conference , which had been scheduled in Paris , 15 days later . Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil . Four days after Powers disappeared , the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had " gone missing " north of Turkey . It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged , and falsely claimed that " the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties . "
Jefferson 's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case Reynolds v. U.S. , in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison , seeking a legal definition for the word religion . Writing for the majority , Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson 's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that " Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion , but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . " Considering this , the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional .
In 2009 , Hispanic and Latino Americans represented 52.0 % of the Bronx 's population . Puerto Ricans represented 23.2 % of the borough 's population . Over 72,500 Mexicans lived in the Bronx , and they formed 5.2 % of the population . Cubans numbered over 9,640 members and formed 0.7 % of the population . In addition , over 319,000 people were of various Hispanic and Latino groups , such as Dominican , Salvadoran , and so on . These groups collectively represented 22.9 % of the population . At the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) . Asian Americans are a small but sizable minority in the borough . Roughly 49,600 Asians make up 3.6 % of the population . Roughly 13,600 Indians call the Bronx home , along with 9,800 Chinese , 6,540 Filipinos , 2,260 Vietnamese , 2,010 Koreans , and 1,100 Japanese .
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . Deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : Juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; Jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . Di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as Mars , Janus , Neptune and various genii – including the Emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . After the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . Rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .
Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature . Published in 2008 , The World In Grey : Dom Bosco 's Prophecy , by author Ryan J. Lucero , tells an apocalypticle story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco . According to Don Bosco 's prophecy : " Between parallels 15 and 20 , around a lake which shall be formed ; A great civilization will thrive , and that will be the Promised Land . " Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S , where an artificial lake ( Paranoá Lake ) was formed . Don Bosco is Brasília 's patron saint .

Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
Starting in the 1970s , the Bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " The Bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film . The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series , when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers . Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire . As the fire was captured on live television , announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " There it is , ladies and gentlemen : the Bronx is burning " . Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to Republic and to Empire . Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . In the early Republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia . The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . Plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . In principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . In reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479 , Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood ( Santa Hermandad ) as a national police force . They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves , and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases . The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835 .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
Within the diasporan Armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of Armenians . For example , Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as Parskahay ( Պարսկահայ ) , while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as Lipananahay ( Լիբանանահայ ) . Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language . This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine , Russia , and Georgia ( where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province ) . In diverse communities ( such as in Canada and the U.S. ) where many different kinds of Armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948 , actual implementation had been slow . Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953 , saying " I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia , including the Federal Government , and any segregation in the Armed Forces " . When he encountered opposition from the services , he used government control of military spending to force the change through , stating " Wherever Federal Funds are expended ... , I do not see how any American can justify ... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds " .
Legendary Princess Bhrikuti ( 7th-century ) and artist Araniko ( 1245 - 1306 AD ) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China . There are over 108 traditional monasteries ( Bahals and Bahis ) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism . Since the 1960s , the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area . Also , with the modernization of Newar Buddhism , various Theravada Bihars have been established .
Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms ( 1521 ) . In his view , faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could , therefore , not be forced on a person . The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience , and they practised separation of church and state . In the early seventeenth century , Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom . Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke 's stance on tolerance . Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams , Congregationalist Thomas Hooker , and Quaker William Penn , respectively , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion . These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities , including Jews . The United States Declaration of Independence , the United States Constitution , and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework . The great majority of American Protestants , both clergy and laity , strongly supported the independence movement . All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world ( e.g. , Latin America , Japan , and Germany ) . The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette , an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles . The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette 's draft of this document . The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a " place of palaces " . There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur . The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , Kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty . The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square . The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap , Kumari Ghar , and Shiva-Parvati Temple ; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace . The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 Nepal earthquake .
On January 17 , 1961 , Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office . In his farewell speech , Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces . He described the Cold War : " We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ... " and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that " we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military–industrial complex . "
Kathmandu is home to Nepali cinema and theaters . The city contains several theaters , including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path , the Ganga Theatre , the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982 . The M. Art Theater is based in the city . The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival , attracting artists from all over the world . A mini theater is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square , established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee .
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns ; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae , and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës , Albania in 1916 , is an early figural example ; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC . Mythological subjects , or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy , were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design , with strongly emphasized borders . Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name , describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl . Both of these themes were widely copied .
The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century , stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort : " The law of love , peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews , Turks and Egyptians , as they are considered sons of Adam , which is the glory of the outward state of Holland , so love , peace and liberty , extending to all in Christ Jesus , condemns hatred , war and bondage . " The document was signed December 27 , 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant . Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony , in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic . The signers indicated their " desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged , neither to condemn least we be condemned , but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master . " Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted . However , John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home . Bowne was arrested , jailed , and sent to the Netherlands for trial ; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne .
The rediscovery of Aristotle 's works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated –fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history . Richard Dales , for instance , calls the discovery of Aristotle 's works " a turning point in the history of Western thought . " After Aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in Latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . The efforts of this " scholasticism " were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason . This became the primary mission of lecturers , and the expectation of students .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003–04 . This fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . In view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in Kathmandu are mainly by road and air . Kathmandu is connected by the Tribhuvan Highway to the south , Prithvi Highway to the west and Araniko Highway to the north . The BP Highway , connecting Kathmandu to the eastern part of Nepal is under construction .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
Raymond B. Bragg , the associate editor of The New Humanist , sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead , Charles Francis Potter , and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference . Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 . Potter 's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
Since then , tourism in Nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu 's religious sites such as Pashupatinath , Swayambhunath , Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha . From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000 . Following the end of the Maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . Since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic . In economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
By contrast , Tom Wolfe 's Bonfire of the Vanities ( 1987 ) portrays a wealthy , white protagonist , Sherman McCoy , getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals . A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse . However , times change , and in 2007 , the New York Times reported that " the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman 's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments . " In the same article , the Reverend Al Sharpton ( whose fictional analogue in the novel is " Reverend Bacon " ) asserts that " twenty years later , the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe 's wardrobe . "
The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson ( later U.S. president ) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House , both from Texas . Joe Martin , the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that Eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . There were exceptions , Leonard W. Hall , for example , who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . However , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
In the wake of the Republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . Augustus , the first Roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . So-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire . Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . This was the context for Rome 's conflict with Christianity , which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
Consistent with Calvin 's political ideas , Protestants created both the English and the American democracies . In seventeenth-century England , the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell , John Milton , John Locke , the Glorious Revolution , the English Bill of Rights , and the Act of Settlement . Later , the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies , e.g . Australia , New Zealand , and India . In North America , Plymouth Colony ( Pilgrim Fathers ; 1620 ) and Massachusetts Bay Colony ( 1628 ) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers . These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God . The Mayflower Compact was a social contract .
Multiracial Americans are also a sizable minority in the Bronx . People of multiracial heritage number over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and African American heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1 % of the population . People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1 % of the population .
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era . Rulers from Tirhut , upon being attacked by Muslims , fled north to the Kathmandu valley . They intermarried with Nepali royalty , and this led to the Malla era . The early years of the Malla era were turbulent , with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims . There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu 's population , including the king Abhaya Malla . These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era ( such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan ) , and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city . Despite the initial hardships , Kathmandu rose to prominence again and , during most of the Malla era , dominated the trade between India and Tibet . Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade .
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
When infection attacks the body , anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection . Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist , depending on the type of organism targeted ; they include antibacterial ( antibiotic ; including antitubercular ) , antiviral , antifungal and antiparasitic ( including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic ) agents . Depending on the severity and the type of infection , the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection , or may be applied topically . Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics . Sometimes , multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic . Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses . Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria . The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin , cephalosporins , aminoglycosides , macrolides , quinolones and tetracyclines . [ citation needed ]
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma . During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana . Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and , as the period progressed , drifted toward the South Pole . Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents ( since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier ) , but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period , causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them . Also , Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia . The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this . By the end of the period , Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated .
The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
Most videos enable users to leave comments , and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content . In 2006 , Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling " community and collaboration on a scale never seen before " , and added that YouTube " harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom . Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone , never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred " . The Guardian in 2009 described users ' comments on YouTube as :
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . Deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : Juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; Jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . Di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as Mars , Janus , Neptune and various genii – including the Emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . After the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . Rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .
As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world , their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them , since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability . One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage , building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion . Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities , including dedications made by Romans to local gods . By the height of the Empire , numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces , among them Cybele , Isis , Epona , and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus , found as far north as Roman Britain . Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only , religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems . The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions , but sometimes to intractable conflict . For example , religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Religious humanism is an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that centre on human needs , interests , and abilities . Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of " humanism " until the late 19th and early 20th centuries , non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history . The Cult of Reason ( French : Culte de la Raison ) was a religion based on deism devised during the French Revolution by Jacques Hébert , Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters . In 1793 during the French Revolution , the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a " Temple to Reason " and for a time Lady Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars . In the 1850s , Auguste Comte , the Father of Sociology , founded Positivism , a " religion of humanity " . One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London . This early group was democratically organised , with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences , philosophy , and the arts . The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876 . The movement 's founder , Felix Adler , a former member of the Free Religious Association , conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions . Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people 's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia . The city is located in an ancient lake basin , with fertile soil and flat terrain . This geography helped form a society based on agriculture . This , combined with its location between India and China , helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries . Kathmandu 's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet . From centuries past , Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia . Other traditional occupations are farming , metal casting , woodcarving , painting , weaving , and pottery .
The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas , garnering little criticism , though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment . The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation . Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology ( the doctrine of how the church as a body works ) , they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers , compared to the Catholics ' idea that certain people within the church , or ideas that were old enough , had a special status in giving understanding of the text .
In terms of ship categories , Greek companies have 22.6 % of the world 's tankers and 16.1 % of the world 's bulk carriers ( in dwt ) . An additional equivalent of 27.45 % of the world 's tanker dwt is on order , with another 12.7 % of bulk carriers also on order . Shipping accounts for an estimated 6 % of Greek GDP , employs about 160,000 people ( 4 % of the workforce ) , and represents 1/3 of the country 's trade deficit . Earnings from shipping amounted to €14.1 billion in 2011 , while between 2000 and 2010 Greek shipping contributed a total of €140 billion ( half of the country 's public debt in 2009 and 3.5 times the receipts from the European Union in the period 2000–2013 ) . The 2011 ECSA report showed that there are approximately 750 Greek shipping companies in operation .
The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society . In the middle Republican era , even Scipio 's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter 's special protege sat ill with his colleagues . Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal ; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus . Julius Caesar went further , and claimed her as his ancestress . Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired ; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation . In 63 BC , Julius Caesar 's appointment as pontifex maximus " signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics " . Likewise , political candidates could sponsor temples , priesthoods and the immensely popular , spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic . Under the principate , such opportunities were limited by law ; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ( " first citizen " ) .

To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow . Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America ( the Western Interior Seaway ) and Europe , then receded late in the period , leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds . At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression , one-third of Earth 's present land area was submerged . The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk ; indeed , more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic . Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather , the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium ; this made the oceans more saturated , as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton . These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine . Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas 's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation . Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China . In the area that is now India , massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene .
" We used a technique of laying our program out in general debate , " he said . When we got to the amendment phase , we would offer our program as a substitute for the Johnson proposal . If we lost in the Committee of the Whole , then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that . And if we lost on the motion to recommit , our Republican members had a choice : They could vote against the Johnson program and say we did our best to come up with a better alternative . Or they could vote for it and make the same argument . Usually we lost ; but when you 're only 140 out of 435 , you do n't expect to win many .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
With the initial investment of £4,200 , the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades , of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and " on the game . " The force was a success after its first year , and his men had " established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives . " Word of this success spread quickly , and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800 , transforming it from a private to public police agency ; now the oldest police force in the world . Colquhoun published a book on the experiment , The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames . It found receptive audiences far outside London , and inspired similar forces in other cities , notably , New York City , Dublin , and Sydney .
The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties , including the power of reason . That means that they are allowed to explore God 's creation and , according to Genesis 2:15 , make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way . Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences . Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers , in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ , are to follow God 's commandments . Industry , frugality , calling , discipline , and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code . In particular , Calvin rejected luxury . Therefore , craftsmen , industrialists , and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology . As a result , productivity grew , which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages . In this way , the economy , the sciences , and technology reinforced each other . The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors . The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution . This idea is also known as the " Protestant ethic thesis . "
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common , their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness , whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment , the nature of immortality , whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium , and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth . The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible , leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath . The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church 's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs ( 1980 and 2005 ) , which use Biblical references as justification .
Since then , tourism in Nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu 's religious sites such as Pashupatinath , Swayambhunath , Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha . From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000 . Following the end of the Maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . Since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic . In economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic : opus vermiculatum used tiny tesserae , typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less , and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support . The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail , and an approach to the illusionism of painting . Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work . The normal technique was opus tessellatum , using larger tesserae , which was laid on site . There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background , which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work .
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . In this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut .
On the domestic front , he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege . He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President , Richard Nixon . He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security . He also launched the Interstate Highway System , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act , and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act .
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
Consistent with Calvin 's political ideas , Protestants created both the English and the American democracies . In seventeenth-century England , the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell , John Milton , John Locke , the Glorious Revolution , the English Bill of Rights , and the Act of Settlement . Later , the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies , e.g . Australia , New Zealand , and India . In North America , Plymouth Colony ( Pilgrim Fathers ; 1620 ) and Massachusetts Bay Colony ( 1628 ) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers . These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God . The Mayflower Compact was a social contract .

The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
Bronx native Nancy Savoca 's 1989 comedy , True Love , explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding . The film , which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple , won the Grand Jury Prize at that year 's Sundance Film Festival . The CBS television sitcom Becker , 1998–2004 , was more ambiguous . The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker , a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients , co-workers , friends , and practically everything and everybody else in his world . It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx .
The phrase " [ A ] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world " was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams , the founder of the colony of Rhode Island , in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution . The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government , in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) :
The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma . Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia . The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow . Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high . Laurentia , Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia . Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole . Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere , and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean , Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean .
At the time , there were many varying opinions about Christian doctrine , and no centralized way of enforcing orthodoxy . Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting , and some 318 bishops ( very few from the Western Empire ) attended the First Council of Nicaea . The purpose of this meeting was to define Christian orthodoxy and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies . The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed and other statements . Later , Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine . Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful . In the early days of Rome 's war against Carthage , the commander Publius Claudius Pulcher ( consul 249 BC ) launched a sea campaign " though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices . " In defiance of the omen , he threw them into the sea , " saying that they might drink , since they would not eat . He was defeated , and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator , he appointed his messenger Glycias , as if again making a jest of his country 's peril . " His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
The city of Kathmandu is named after Kasthamandap temple , that stood in Durbar Square . In Sanskrit , Kastha ( काष्ठ ) means " wood " and Mandap ( /मण्डप ) means " covered shelter " . This temple , also known as Maru Satal in the Newar language , was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla . The two-storey structure was made entirely of wood , and used no iron nails nor supports . According to legend , all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree . The structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
Eisenhower 's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations , a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan , and The American Assembly , Eisenhower 's " vision of a great cultural center where business , professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature " . His biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as " the political education of General Eisenhower " , since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational , administrative , and financial demands for the university . Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations , he also gained exposure to economic analysis , which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy . " Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics , he has learned at the study group meetings , " one Aid to Europe member claimed .
From 1879 , Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically . Thirty congregations were founded , and during 1879 and 1880 , Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings . As congregations continued to form during Russell 's ministry , they each remained self-administrative , functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance . In 1881 , Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley , and in 1884 , Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles . By about 1900 , Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs , and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices . By the 1910s , Russell 's organization maintained nearly a hundred " pilgrims , " or traveling preachers . Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry , and by 1912 , he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States .
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 . In November 2006 , it was bought by Google for US $ 1.65 billion . YouTube now operates as one of Google 's subsidiaries . The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the United States , the 15th , but its wide diversity also includes affluent , upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale , Fieldston , Spuyten Duyvil , Schuylerville , Pelham Bay , Pelham Gardens , Morris Park and Country Club . The Bronx , particularly the South Bronx , saw a sharp decline in population , livable housing , and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s , culminating in a wave of arson . Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace in the 1990s into today .
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years ( Deflem , 2002 ) . For example , in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals . A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London . The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe , which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War . There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) . It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception . It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( Sheptycki , 2000 ) .

At the end of May 1942 , Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold , commanding general of the Army Air Forces , to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England , Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney . He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment , stating he had an " uneasy feeling " about Chaney and his staff . On June 23 , 1942 , he returned to London as Commanding General , European Theater of Operations ( ETOUSA ) , based in London and with a house on Coombe , Kingston upon Thames , and replaced Chaney . He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7 .
In a video posted on July 21 , 2009 , YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos . The videos can be viewed in several different ways , including the common anaglyph ( cyan/red lens ) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect . The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows , columns or a checkerboard pattern , side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan , green/magenta or blue/yellow combination . In May 2011 , an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision .
At the 2009 American Community Survey , Black Americans made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos . Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third ( 35.4 % ) of the Bronx 's population . Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8 % of the population . Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough , of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks . Over 61,000 people identified themselves as " Sub-Saharan African " in the survey , making up 4.4 % of the population .
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith ( see Christian Humanism ) . They inveighed against the abuses of the Church , but not against the Church itself , much less against religion . For them , the word " secular " carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later , in the nineteenth century . In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery . Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo 's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own ( although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life ) . He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue , inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer . By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base , however , the methods of the humanists , combined with their eloquence , would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority .
In the later Imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped . Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica . The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; St Augustine ( following St Ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567 . Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .
6th-century BCE pre-Socratic Greek philosophers Thales of Miletus and Xenophanes of Colophon were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition , thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists . Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe . These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm . Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens . Pericles , the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras . Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include Protagoras ( like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles ) , known for his famous dictum " man is the measure of all things " and Democritus , who proposed that matter was composed of atoms . Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers , principally Plato and Aristotle . The historian Thucydides , noted for his scientific and rational approach to history , is also much admired by later humanists . In the 3rd century BCE , Epicurus became known for his concise phrasing of the problem of evil , lack of belief in the afterlife , and human-centred approaches to achieving eudaimonia . He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule .
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur . The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space , and only later referred to a building . Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space ; its ancient boundary ( pomerium ) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough ; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state . In Rome , the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra ( Sacred Way ) and the pomerium . Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur , who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before , during and after an act of sacrifice . Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice , errant rites ( vitium ) or an unacceptable plan of action . If an unfavourable sign was given , the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen , consult with his augural colleagues , or abandon the project . Magistrates could use their right of augury ( ius augurum ) to adjourn and overturn the process of law , but were obliged to base their decision on the augur 's observations and advice . For Cicero , himself an augur , this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic . By his time ( mid 1st century BC ) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices , whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading . Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children , and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline , usually from David . His mother , previously a member ( with David ) of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites , joined the International Bible Students Association , later known as Jehovah 's Witnesses . The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 , though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students . His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother , who felt that warfare was " rather wicked , " but she did not overrule him . While speaking of himself in 1948 , Eisenhower said he was " one of the most deeply religious men I know " though unattached to any " sect or organization " . He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953 .
As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid-1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9.7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5 % per year .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .

The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
In 2014 YouTube said that 300 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute , three times more than one year earlier and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the U.S . The site has 800 million unique users a month . It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 . According to third-party web analytics providers , Alexa and SimilarWeb , YouTube is the third most visited website in the world , as of June 2015 ; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally , attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
In the Presidential primary elections of February 5 , 2008 , Sen. Clinton won 61.2 % of the Bronx 's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8 % for Barack Obama and 1.0 % for the other four candidates combined ( John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Bill Richardson and Joe Biden ) . On the same day , John McCain won 54.4 % of the borough 's 5,643 Republican votes , Mitt Romney 20.8 % , Mike Huckabee 8.2 % , Ron Paul 7.4 % , Rudy Giuliani 5.6 % , and the other candidates ( Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes ) 3.6 % between them .
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time , as individual scientists , associations and universities were vying for limited resources . There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public , or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities . Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors , and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions , they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors .
Punjab 's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan , the Jhelum , Chenab , Ravi , and Sutlej rivers . There are several mountainous regions , including the Sulaiman Mountains in the southwest part of the province , and Margalla Hills , Salt Range , and Pothohar Plateau in the north . Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment in Punjab ; wheat and cotton are the principal crops . Since independence , Punjab has become the seat of political and economic power ; it remains the most industrialised province of Pakistan . It counts for 39.2 % of large scale manufacturing and 70 % of small scale manufacturing in the country . Its capital Lahore is a major regional cultural , historical , and economic centre .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
An exceptionally well preserved , carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany , the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390 . Because of its purely geometrical pattern , the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas , especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem . A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor .
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
Instruments like the duduk , the dhol , the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music . Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music . One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia . Many of these chants are ancient in origin , extending to pre-Christian times , while others are relatively modern , including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots , the inventor of the Armenian alphabet . Whilst under Soviet rule , Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music , for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane .
J. Brent Walker , Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee , responded to Hamburger 's claims noting ; " The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle . Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture . Of course , separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools . But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry "
Angels in the Outfield was Eisenhower 's favorite movie . His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels of Zane Grey . With his excellent memory and ability to focus , Eisenhower was skilled at card games . He learned poker , which he called his " favorite indoor sport , " in Abilene . Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates ' poker losses for payment after graduation , and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him . A classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point , Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
Historians trace the earliest church labeled Baptist back to 1609 in Amsterdam , with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the mid-18th century , the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South . The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership , as did the preachers ' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery , which had been part of the 18th-century teachings . Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent .
The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens , that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama , Vice President Biden , White House staff , and several cabinet secretaries . Similarly , in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd 's video " My story : Struggling , bullying , suicide , self-harm " , legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
In July 1953 , an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 . The armistice and boundary remain in effect today , with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it . The armistice , concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles , South Korean President Syngman Rhee , and also within Eisenhower 's party , has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration . Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable , and limited war unwinnable .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent . Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a microbe in a community , and other epidemiological considerations . Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively shaped the Church of Scotland . The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines , and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France . John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation . The Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope 's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560 , forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith . It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise , who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter .
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 . In November 2008 , YouTube reached an agreement with MGM , Lions Gate Entertainment , and CBS , allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site , accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called " Shows " . The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu , which features material from NBC , Fox , and Disney . In November 2009 , YouTube launched a version of " Shows " available to UK viewers , offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners . In January 2010 , YouTube introduced an online film rentals service , which is available only to users in the US , Canada and the UK as of 2010 . The service offers over 6,000 films .
The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community . Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta 's flame . The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home . Besides their own festival of Vestalia , they participated directly in the rites of Parilia , Parentalia and Fordicidia . Indirectly , they played a role in every official sacrifice ; among their duties was the preparation of the mola salsa , the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation .
His primary duty was planning for the next war , which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression . He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur , Army Chief of Staff . In 1932 , he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington , D.C . Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it , he later wrote the Army 's official incident report , endorsing MacArthur 's conduct .
In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day . By the end of the Mesozoic era , the continents had rifted into nearly their present form . Laurasia became North America and Eurasia , while Gondwana split into South America , Africa , Australia , Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent , which collided with the Asian plate . This impact gave rise to the Himalayas . The Tethys Sea , which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India , began to close up , forming the Mediterranean sea .
Punjab is Pakistan 's second largest province in terms of land area at 205,344 km2 ( 79,284 sq mi ) , after Balochistan , and is located at the north western edge of the geologic Indian plate in South Asia . The province is bordered by Kashmir ( Azad Kashmir , Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir , India ) to the northeast , the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east , the Pakistani province of Sindh to the south , the province of Balochistan to the southwest , the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the north .
Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD , when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet . This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature . Early Armenian literature was written by the " father of Armenian history " , Moses of Chorene , who authored The History of Armenia . The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD . The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature . This period of time , during which Armenian culture flourished , is known as the Revival period ( Zartonki sherchan ) . The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis , almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe , were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism . Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience , and preferred them over classical Armenian ( grabar ) . This period ended after the Hamidian massacres , when Armenians experienced turbulent times . As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed , writers like Paruyr Sevak , Gevork Emin , Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons . First , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified . Second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease . This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR . Third , the essential tools for directing PCR , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
At the 2009 American Community Survey , Black Americans made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos . Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third ( 35.4 % ) of the Bronx 's population . Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8 % of the population . Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough , of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks . Over 61,000 people identified themselves as " Sub-Saharan African " in the survey , making up 4.4 % of the population .
The city 's planned design included specific areas for almost everything , including accommodation , Hotels Sectors North and South . New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere , such as the hotels and tourism Sector North , located on the shores of Lake Paranoá . Brasília has a range of tourist accommodation from inns , pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels . The city 's restaurants cater to a wide range of foods from local and regional Brazilian dishes to international cuisine .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .

Brent Walker , Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee , responded to Hamburger 's claims noting ; " The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle .

Gephardt added that " inclusion and empowerment of the people on the line have to be done to get the best performance " from the minority party . Other techniques for fostering party harmony include the appointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with conflicting views to reach consensus on issues ; the creation of new leadership positions as a way to reach out and involve a greater diversity of partisans in the leadership structure ; and daily meetings in the Leader 's office ( or at breakfast , lunch , or dinner ) to lay out floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party .
The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus , inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition . Yaroslav , the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , Kiev . The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral . It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen , sent by Constantine Monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels . Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above . Below is a Communion of the Apostles .
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . Deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : Juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; Jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . Di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as Mars , Janus , Neptune and various genii – including the Emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . After the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . Rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
Russell moved the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters to Brooklyn , New York , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel . He identified the religious movement as " Bible Students , " and more formally as the International Bible Students Association . By 1910 , about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re-elected him annually as their " pastor . " Russell died October 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour .
Despite its tropical wet and dry climate , extensive irrigation makes it a rich agricultural region . Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world . Wheat and cotton are the largest crops . Other crops include rice , sugarcane , millet , corn , oilseeds , pulses , vegetables , and fruits such as kinoo . Livestock and poultry production are also important . Despite past animosities , the rural masses in Punjab 's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting .
The terms international policing , transnational policing , and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) , ( Sheptycki , 1995 ) . These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that , in some sense , transcend national borders . This includes a variety of practices , but international police cooperation , criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation-states , and police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention .
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) , law , grammar and rhetoric . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum , while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship . The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs can not be underestimated . Once humanist professors joined the university faculty , they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction , to translate and interpret classical texts , and to live honorable lives . Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts , as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts . Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno , Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts . The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship . For instance , Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen , whose ideas he verified through his own dissections . In law , Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective , while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist . Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts , which was important for the reform at Protestant universities . Galileo Galilei , who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua , and Martin Luther , who taught at the University of Wittenberg ( as did Melanchthon ) , also had humanist training . The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university ; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs , syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship .
In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament . The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections . In talks located in London that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower , when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections . In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria , and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S. , U.K. and France . At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called " Open Skies " to facilitate disarmament , which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other 's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
On November 6 , 2013 , Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented . The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments . They give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . In response , YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question " why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island , Chase Melvin noted that " Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who do n't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system " . In the same article Melvin goes on to say :
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
Several versions of a semi-official , structured pantheon were developed during the political , social and religious instability of the Late Republican era . Jupiter , the most powerful of all gods and " the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested " , consistently personified the divine authority of Rome 's highest offices , internal organization and external relations . During the archaic and early Republican eras , he shared his temple , some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus , who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva . A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres , Liber and Libera , and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult . Other major and minor deities could be single , coupled , or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure . These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic , part philosophical creations , and often Greek in origin . The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians , and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage .
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
The Bronx has several local newspapers , including The Bronx News , Parkchester News , City News , The Riverdale Press , Riverdale Review , The Bronx Times Reporter , Inner City Press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and Co-Op City Times . Four non-profit news outlets , Norwood News , Mount Hope Monitor , Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough 's poorer communities . The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press , Bernard Stein , won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998 . ( Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959 . )
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers . According to Gopalraj Vansawali , a genealogy of Nepali monarchs , the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas , Mahispalas , Aabhirs , Kirants , and Somavanshi . The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber . During the Kirata era , a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu . In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages , Kathmandu is still called Yambu . Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu , near Manjupattan . During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler , Jitedasti , Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu .
The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building , as the supercontinent Pangea came together . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana , which collided with North America-Europe ( Laurussia ) along the present line of eastern North America . This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe , and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America ; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains . In the same time frame , much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains . There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys . Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean ( closed by the assembly of South and North America ) , the small , shallow Ural Ocean ( which was closed by the collision of Baltica , and Siberia continents , creating the Ural Mountains ) and Proto-Tethys Ocean .
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends . According to Swayambhu Purana , present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake names " Nagdaha " as it was full of snakes . The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa Manjusri with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land . After sometimes , a demon named Banasur closed the outlet and the valley was again a lake . Then lots Krishna came to Nepal , killed Banasur and again drained out water . He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era . Rulers from Tirhut , upon being attacked by Muslims , fled north to the Kathmandu valley . They intermarried with Nepali royalty , and this led to the Malla era . The early years of the Malla era were turbulent , with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims . There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu 's population , including the king Abhaya Malla . These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era ( such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan ) , and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city . Despite the initial hardships , Kathmandu rose to prominence again and , during most of the Malla era , dominated the trade between India and Tibet . Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns . Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound , T. E. Hulme , and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental " slop " ( Hulme ) [ citation needed ] or " an old bitch gone in the teeth " ( Pound ) and wanted to go back to a more manly , authoritarian society such as ( they believed ) existed in the Middle Ages . Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists , such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault , have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature , which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human . " Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal " , suggests Timothy Laurie , turning the human into what he calls " a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans ( e.g . rationality , altruism ) , rather than most commonplace ( e.g . hunger , anger ) " . Nevertheless , philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals , anti-humanism thus frequently " secretes a humanist rhetoric " .
The Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the President of Brazil . The palace was designed , along with the rest of the city of Brasília , by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958 . One of the first structures built in the republic 's new capital city , the " Alvorada " lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Paranoá . The principles of simplicity and modernity , that in the past characterized the great works of architecture , motivated Niemeyer . The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box , softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns . The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement , landing , and second floor . The auditorium , kitchen , laundry , medical center , and administration offices are at basement level . The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing . The second floor has four suites , two apartments , and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace . The building also has a library , a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool , a music room , two dining rooms and various meeting rooms . A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings .
In November 1956 , Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British , French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis , receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt . Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty-five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand-year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid-1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s .
Angels in the Outfield was Eisenhower 's favorite movie . His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels of Zane Grey . With his excellent memory and ability to focus , Eisenhower was skilled at card games . He learned poker , which he called his " favorite indoor sport , " in Abilene . Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates ' poker losses for payment after graduation , and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him . A classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point , Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
During the Reformation , the term was hardly used outside of the German politics . The word evangelical ( German : evangelisch ) , which refers to the gospel , was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement . Nowadays , this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations , above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD . The German word evangelisch means Protestant , and is different from the German evangelikal , which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism . The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches , and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole . It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England , where Evangelicalism originated , and then was brought to the United States . The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German , and is different from English reformed ( German : reformiert ) , which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians .
As of 2010 , 46.29 % ( 584,463 ) of Bronx residents aged five and older spoke Spanish at home , while 44.02 % ( 555,767 ) spoke English , 2.48 % ( 31,361 ) African languages , 0.91 % ( 11,455 ) French , 0.90 % ( 11,355 ) Italian , 0.87 % ( 10,946 ) various Indic languages , 0.70 % ( 8,836 ) other Indo-European languages , and Chinese was spoken at home by 0.50 % ( 6,610 ) of the population over the age of five . In total , 55.98 % ( 706,783 ) of the Bronx 's population age five and older spoke a language at home other than English . A Garifuna-speaking community from Honduras and Guatemala also makes the Bronx its home .
Maharaja Ranjit Singh 's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state . Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down , starting the First Anglo-Sikh War ; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to British India . After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 , the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India . In Jhelum 35 British soldiers of HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . [ citation needed ]
When infection attacks the body , anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection . Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist , depending on the type of organism targeted ; they include antibacterial ( antibiotic ; including antitubercular ) , antiviral , antifungal and antiparasitic ( including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic ) agents . Depending on the severity and the type of infection , the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection , or may be applied topically . Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics . Sometimes , multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic . Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses . Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria . The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin , cephalosporins , aminoglycosides , macrolides , quinolones and tetracyclines . [ citation needed ]
The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world . Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music . In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called " kef " style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular . This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated . Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional " kef " style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of " kef music " heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time . Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia . Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry . Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan . Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent . In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .
The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party , and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader . Unlike the Majority Leader , the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress . If the Minority Leader 's party takes control of the House , and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats , the Minority Leader is usually the party 's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress , while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader . The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues .
The view of the Roman Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations can not be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas , and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession . According to Bishop Hilarion ( Alfeyev ) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject .
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
He assumed duties again at Camp Meade , Maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . His schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton , Sereno E. Brett , and other senior tank leaders . Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639 . The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various European countries ( particularly Ireland , Germany and Italy ) and later from the Caribbean region ( particularly Puerto Rico , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic ) , as well as African American migrants from the American South . This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop .
A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Some legal scholars , such as John Baker of LSU , theorize that Madison 's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " —was rejected by the House , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists . To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown . During the debate over the establishment clause , Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison 's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .

By the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state , with a large plebeian , artisan class excluded from the old patrician gentes and from the state priesthoods . The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours ; according to tradition , Rome 's Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine ; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter , Juno and Minerva , installed in a Capitoline temple , built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival , Epulum Jovis . These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned , as if noble guests , at their own inaugural banquet .
This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing . Following the airport 's master plan , Infraero built a second runway , which was finished in 2006 . In 2007 , the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers . The main building 's third floor , with 12 thousand square meters , has a panoramic deck , a food court , shops , four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people , and space for exhibitions . Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces . The airport is located about 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) from the central area of Brasília , outside the metro system . The area outside the airport 's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília 's central district . The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars . The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines ( TAM , GOL , Azul , WebJET , Trip and Avianca ) , in addition to a number of international carriers . In 2012 , Brasília 's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium , formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company , with a 50 % stake each . During the 25-year concession , the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world . In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state , while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay . In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town , while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world , and may provide university accommodation for their students .
YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005 . The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in September 2005 . Following a $ 3.5 million investment from Sequoia Capital in November , the site launched officially on December 15 , 2005 , by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day . The site grew rapidly , and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day , and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day . According to data published by market research company comScore , YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States , with a market share of around 43 % and more than 14 billion views of videos in May 2010 .
The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond . Terence , an African and a former slave , was well placed to preach the message of universalism , of the essential unity of the human race , that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks , but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality . The influence of Terence 's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated . Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call :
On December 20 , 2005 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed , because the purpose of the display ( educating the public on American legal traditions ) was secular in nature . In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3 , 2006 , however , a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed .
Protestantism spread in Europe during the 16th century . Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] Denmark , [ d ] Norway , [ e ] Sweden , [ f ] Finland , [ g ] Prussia , [ h ] Latvia , [ i ] , Estonia , [ j ] and Iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] Hungary , [ m ] the Netherlands , [ n ] Scotland , [ o ] Switzerland , [ p ] and France [ q ] by such reformers as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . Arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany . In 1534 , King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England [ s ] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of Edward VI , through Thomas Cranmer , Richard Hooker , Matthew Parker and other theologians . There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist , Moravian , and other Pietistic movements . In later centuries , Protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .
Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life , and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948 . He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game , to the point of golfing during winter ; he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground . He had a small , basic golf facility installed at Camp David , and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts , inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions . Roberts , an investment broker , also handled the Eisenhower family 's investments . Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs , which proved financially lucrative .
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences . Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . Concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . While YouTube 's revenue-sharing " Partner Program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels " . In 2013 Forbes ' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media . In 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega " , " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo . By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts .
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government , such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates ( 2007 ) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video , with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape . Describing the Arab Spring ( 2010- ) , sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist 's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using " Facebook to schedule the protests , Twitter to coordinate , and YouTube to tell the world . " In 2012 , more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the " Kony 2012 " video was posted to YouTube , with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video " will do more to lead to ( Kony 's ) demise than all other action combined . "
The humanists ' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods . By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin , they applied the principle of ad fontes , or back to the sources , across broad areas of learning , seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors . In 1439 , while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon ( at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States ) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis , now called philology , to prove that the Donation of Constantine , which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome , was an 8th-century forgery . For the next 70 years , however , neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way . Instead , after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453 , which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy , humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism , hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches , and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world . The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts , not only of Plato and Aristotle , but also of the Christian Gospels , previously unavailable in the Latin West .
The name Anabaptist , meaning " one who baptizes again " , was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants . Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants . The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist , claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void , the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism . As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues , Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics . [ aa ] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount , which precluded taking oaths , participating in military actions , and participating in civil government , some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise . [ ab ] They were thus technically Anabaptists , even though conservative Amish , Mennonites , and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism . Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front . Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden , Thomas Müntzer , Kaspar Schwenkfeld , Sebastian Franck , Menno Simons . Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck , Conrad Grebel , Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz .
Consistent with Calvin 's political ideas , Protestants created both the English and the American democracies . In seventeenth-century England , the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell , John Milton , John Locke , the Glorious Revolution , the English Bill of Rights , and the Act of Settlement . Later , the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies , e.g . Australia , New Zealand , and India . In North America , Plymouth Colony ( Pilgrim Fathers ; 1620 ) and Massachusetts Bay Colony ( 1628 ) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers . These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God . The Mayflower Compact was a social contract .
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
In the 1990s , New York City began closing the large , public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools . Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety . Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include John F. Kennedy , James Monroe , Taft , Theodore Roosevelt , Adlai Stevenson , Evander Childs , Christopher Columbus , Morris , Walton , and South Bronx High Schools . More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools , also replacing them with smaller schools .
There are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos ( 1122–34 ) . The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name , Piroska shows . The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier ( from 1122 ) is similarly personal . The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty , the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed . The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent . There is only a " Communion of the Apostles " in the apse of the cathedral of Serres .
In the course of this religious upheaval , the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 swept through the Bavarian , Thuringian and Swabian principalities . After the Eighty Years ' War in the Low Countries and the French Wars of Religion , the confessional division of the states of the Holy Roman Empire eventually erupted in the Thirty Years ' War between 1618 and 1648 . It devastated much of Germany , killing between 25 % and 40 % of its population . The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , were :
A loblolly pine , known as the " Eisenhower Pine " , was located on Augusta 's 17th hole , approximately 210 yards ( 192 m ) from the Masters tee . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , an Augusta National member , hit the tree so many times that , at a 1956 club meeting , he proposed that it be cut down . Not wanting to offend the president , the club 's chairman , Clifford Roberts , immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request . The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage .
Kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . The average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley : south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City ( Patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by Kirtipur Municipality and to the east by Madyapur Thimi Municipality . To the north the urban area extends into several Village Development Committees . However , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley .
Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings , individually and collectively , and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence ( rationalism , empiricism ) over acceptance of dogma or superstition . The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it . Generally , however , humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress . In modern times , humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism , and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world .
In May 1955 , McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel . Eisenhower was furious , and issued an order as follows : " It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters ... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications , or any documents or reproductions , concerning such advice be disclosed . " This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting , and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege . Ike 's denial of McCarthy 's access to his staff reduced McCarthy 's hearings to rants about trivial matters , and contributed to his ultimate downfall .
The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
The city has a unique status in Brazil , as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other cities in Brazil . The name 'Brasília ' is commonly used as a synonym for the Federal District through synecdoche ; However , the Federal District is composed of 31 administrative regions , only one of which is Brasília proper , with a population of 209,926 in a 2011 survey ; Demographic publications generally do not make this distinction and list the population of Brasília as synonymous with the population of the Federal District , considering the whole of it as its metropolitan area . The city was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Additionally , Brasília hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
In brief , there is disagreement among historical analysts as to the exact time period when the minority leadership emerged officially as a party position . Nonetheless , it seems safe to conclude that the position emerged during the latter part of the 19th century , a period of strong party organization and professional politicians . This era was " marked by strong partisan attachments , resilient patronage-based party organizations , and ... high levels of party voting in Congress . " Plainly , these were conditions conducive to the establishment of a more highly differentiated House leadership structure .
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up , as Europe , Greenland and North America drifted apart . In western North America , mountain building started in the Eocene , and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts . In Europe , the Tethys Sea finally vanished , while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant , the Mediterranean , and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north . Though the North Atlantic was opening , a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia , creating the Himalayan orogeny .
Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , Armenia was an independent republic . In late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army , and in 1922 , Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union , later forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 1936 to September 21 , 1991 ) . In 1991 , Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to Republic and to Empire . Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . In the early Republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia . The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . Plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . In principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . In reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond .
The Nea Moni Monastery on Chios was established by Constantine Monomachos in 1043–1056 . The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived ( Theotokos with raised hands , four evangelists with seraphim , scenes from Christ 's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos ) . In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures , detail , landscape and setting .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
The Earth of the early Archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . During this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . From that point on , Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution . During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century , “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms” , regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State , and therefore threatened its existence . The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism ; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework . Christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
The enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu . " Narayanhity " comes from Narayana , a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu , and Hiti , meaning " water spout " ( Vishnu 's temple is located opposite the palace , and the water spout is located east of the main entrance to the precinct ) . Narayanhity was a new palace , in front of the old palace built in 1915 , and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary Pagoda . It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah , then heir apparent to the throne . The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads . The palace area covers ( 30 hectares ( 74 acres ) ) and is fully secured with gates on all sides . This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre . After the fall of the monarchy , it was converted to a museum .
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
Most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . However , it was the retroactive application of ESA95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by Eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of GDP , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . This led to claims that Greece ( similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .
The roles and responsibilities of the minority leader are not well-defined . To a large extent , the functions of the minority leader are defined by tradition and custom . A minority leader from 1931 to 1939 , Representative Bertrand Snell , R-N.Y. , provided this " job description " : " He is spokesman for his party and enunciates its policies . He is required to be alert and vigilant in defense of the minority 's rights . It is his function and duty to criticize constructively the policies and programs of the majority , and to this end employ parliamentary tactics and give close attention to all proposed legislation .

YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate , and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site 's terms of service . In July 2008 , the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was " unimpressed " with YouTube 's system for policing its videos , and argued that " proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content " . YouTube responded by stating :
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .
As a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece 's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country 's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7 % in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) . In order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries , and the IMF , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling €110 billion . In order to secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control . Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .

South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to South America 's distinctive marsupial faunas . The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean . Africa 's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea , cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean . Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia . Near the end of the Pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the Quaternary Period ) , the current ice age began . The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
Throughout his presidency , Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism . A self-described " progressive conservative , " he continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation , especially Social Security . He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers . He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years , which had not been completed under Truman .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
Religious humanism is an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that centre on human needs , interests , and abilities . Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of " humanism " until the late 19th and early 20th centuries , non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history . The Cult of Reason ( French : Culte de la Raison ) was a religion based on deism devised during the French Revolution by Jacques Hébert , Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters . In 1793 during the French Revolution , the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a " Temple to Reason " and for a time Lady Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars . In the 1850s , Auguste Comte , the Father of Sociology , founded Positivism , a " religion of humanity " . One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London . This early group was democratically organised , with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences , philosophy , and the arts . The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876 . The movement 's founder , Felix Adler , a former member of the Free Religious Association , conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions . Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people 's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern .
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures ; in principle , Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin , Etruscan and other Italian peoples , cults and deities as Roman . Those who acknowledged Rome 's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars , independent of Roman religious law . Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis . Autonomy and concord were official policy , but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models . Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages , especially to local elites . All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia . By the middle of the 1st century AD , Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established , Romanised cult nearby : by the end of that century , Sabratha’s so-called tophet was no longer in use . Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome 's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice , not a centralised legal requirement . Major cult centres to " non-Roman " deities continued to prosper : notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium , the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo 's sacred wood at Antioch .
During the later part of the Malla era , Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities : Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , and Kirtipur . These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal . These states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . Evidence of an influx of ideas from India , Tibet , China , Persia , and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla . Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g . Tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g . Haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g . Mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . Amarkosh , a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD , was also found . Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square , Patan Durbar Square , Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the former durbar of Kirtipur , Nyatapola , Kumbheshwar , the Krishna temple , and others .
In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation , the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough . Radical Reformer , Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt , for example , referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the " new papists " . Since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes . A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut , although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
According to the 2009 American Community Survey , White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth ( 22.9 % ) of the Bronx 's population . However , non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth ( 12.1 % ) of the population , down from 34.4 % in 1980 . Out of all five boroughs , the Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents . 320,640 whites called the Bronx home , of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites . The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent . People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9 % of the population . People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1 % of the population . German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4 % and 0.8 % of the population respectively .
A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize . However , as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church , all other sacraments ( except marriage ) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid . Therefore , Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized ( although they are confirmed ) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study .
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
In July 1953 , an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 . The armistice and boundary remain in effect today , with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it . The armistice , concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles , South Korean President Syngman Rhee , and also within Eisenhower 's party , has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration . Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable , and limited war unwinnable .
A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics .
In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 7.2 % it accounted for in 2006 , but still below the EU average of 10 % in 2008 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . In 2013 and for several months , Greece produced more than 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century , stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort : " The law of love , peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews , Turks and Egyptians , as they are considered sons of Adam , which is the glory of the outward state of Holland , so love , peace and liberty , extending to all in Christ Jesus , condemns hatred , war and bondage . " The document was signed December 27 , 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant . Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony , in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic . The signers indicated their " desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged , neither to condemn least we be condemned , but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master . " Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted . However , John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home . Bowne was arrested , jailed , and sent to the Netherlands for trial ; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne .

Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement .
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
The Bronx 's highest elevation at 280 feet ( 85 m ) is in the northwest corner , west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School . The opposite ( southeastern ) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or " necks " of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh : Hunt 's Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck and Throg 's Neck . Further up the coastline , Rodman 's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island . The Bronx 's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles ( 194 km2 ) .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago . Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the Holocene . In addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene , and are still rising today . The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea . Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont , Quebec , Ontario and Michigan . Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin . Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea , including much of Finland . The region continues to rise , still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe . The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger , immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase , to near its present boundaries .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from God , and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements . They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed . Jehovah 's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " The Witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah 's approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan . Witnesses are taught that association with " worldly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality .
Since June 2007 , YouTube 's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products . This required YouTube 's content to be transcoded into Apple 's preferred video standard , H.264 , a process that took several months . YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV , iPod Touch and the iPhone . In July 2010 , the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 , avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls . The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform . In September 2012 , YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone , following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system . According to GlobalWebIndex , YouTube was used by 35 % of smartphone users between April and June 2013 , making it the third most used app .
The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south , although the northern ( primarily Germany , France and Great Britain ) and southern universities ( primarily Italy ) did have many elements in common . Latin was the language of the university , used for all texts , lectures , disputations and examinations . Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic , natural philosophy , and metaphysics ; while Hippocrates , Galen , and Avicenna were used for medicine . Outside of these commonalities , great differences separated north and south , primarily in subject matter . Italian universities focused on law and medicine , while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology . There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus , so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means . There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities . English , French and German universities usually awarded bachelor 's degrees , with the exception of degrees in theology , for which the doctorate was more common . Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates . The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions , while in the south students often went on to professional positions . The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris . Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna . Among the southern universities , a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy , which followed the pattern of Bologna as a " self-regulating , independent corporation of scholars " and those of southern Italy and Iberia , which were " founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government . "
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
The Boudhanath , ( also written Bouddhanath , Bodhnath , Baudhanath or the Khāsa Chaitya ) , is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal , along with Swayambhu . It is a very popular tourist site . Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali . Located about 11 km ( 7 mi ) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu , the stupa 's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal . Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 .
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery , exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university , and the ideas of those texts into society generally , their influence was ultimately quite progressive . The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate ( as the notable list of scholars above attests to ) . A focus on knowledge coming from self , from the human , has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction , and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities . This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts , but also their adaptation and expansion . For instance , Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen , but he also invigorated this text with experimentation , disagreements and further research . The propagation of these texts , especially within the universities , was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular , which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices .
The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa ( now Umm ar-Rasas ) were made in 785 ( discovered after 1986 ) . The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan . On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region . The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative . Six mosaic masters signed the work : Staurachios from Esbus , Euremios , Elias , Constantinus , Germanus and Abdela . It overlays another , damaged , mosaic floor of the earlier ( 587 ) " Church of Bishop Sergius . " Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century . Among the rare examples are the 6th-century Christ in majesty ( or Ezekiel 's Vision ) mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times . Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church , which were made between 634 and 730 , also escaped destruction . Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki , often with suppliants before him .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day . By the end of the Mesozoic era , the continents had rifted into nearly their present form . Laurasia became North America and Eurasia , while Gondwana split into South America , Africa , Australia , Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent , which collided with the Asian plate . This impact gave rise to the Himalayas . The Tethys Sea , which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India , began to close up , forming the Mediterranean sea .
While the decision ( with four dissents ) ultimately upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools , the majority opinion ( by Justice Hugo Black ) and the dissenting opinions ( by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge and Justice Robert H. Jackson ) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a " wall between church and state " or a " separation of Church from State " : their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall . Rutledge , on behalf of the four dissenting justices , took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case : " Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia 's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment , now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth . " Writing separately , Justice Jackson argued that " [ T ] here are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation . In fact , the undertones of the opinion , advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State , seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters . "
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "
The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .
The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County , one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York . The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers , Eastchester , and Pelham . In 1846 , a new town , West Farms , was created by division of Westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of Morrisania was created from West Farms . In 1873 , the town of Kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge , Riverdale , and Woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of Yonkers .
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine 's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt . Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine 's Monastery is exceptional . On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background . In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background . The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets , and two contemporary figure , " Abbot Longinos " and " John the Deacon " . The mosaic was probably created in 565/6 .
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington , where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany . He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division ( WPD ) , General Leonard T. Gerow , and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division . Next , he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division ( which replaced WPD ) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body , grows and multiplies . This is referred to as colonization . Most humans are not easily infected . Those who are weak , sick , malnourished , have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections . Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections . Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface , generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity , nose , eyes , genitalia , anus , or the microbe can enter through open wounds . While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry , many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs . Some pathogens grow within the host cells ( intracellular ) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids .
Greece was accused of trying to cover up the extent of its massive budget deficit in the wake of the global financial crisis . The allegation was prompted by the massive revision of the 2009 budget deficit forecast by the new PASOK government elected in October 2009 , from " 6–8 % " ( estimated by the previous New Democracy government ) to 12.7 % ( later revised to 15.7 % ) . However , the accuracy of the revised figures has also been questioned , and in February 2012 the Hellenic Parliament voted in favor of an official investigation following accusations by a former member of the Hellenic Statistical Authority that the deficit had been artificially inflated in order to justify harsher austerity measures .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe , although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals . The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár ( Alba Regia ) had a mosaic decoration in the apse . It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen , executed in the first decades of the 11th century . The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century . The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal . It was executed by Venetian craftsmen .
The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza . In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus , identified by his name in Hebrew letters . Near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . The floor was paved in 508/509 . It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon ( Menois ) and the Christian church at Shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
By the end of the early modern period , the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context . Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging . The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture , and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state .
Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , Armenia was an independent republic . In late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army , and in 1922 , Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union , later forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 1936 to September 21 , 1991 ) . In 1991 , Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods , so did some individual Romans . In the mid-to-late Republican era , and probably much earlier , many of Rome 's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult , along with a share of their divinity . Most notably in the very late Republic , the Julii claimed Venus Genetrix as ancestor ; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult . The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil 's poetic , Imperial vision of the past .
The roles and responsibilities of the minority leader are not well-defined . To a large extent , the functions of the minority leader are defined by tradition and custom . A minority leader from 1931 to 1939 , Representative Bertrand Snell , R-N.Y. , provided this " job description " : " He is spokesman for his party and enunciates its policies . He is required to be alert and vigilant in defense of the minority 's rights . It is his function and duty to criticize constructively the policies and programs of the majority , and to this end employ parliamentary tactics and give close attention to all proposed legislation . "
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas , garnering little criticism , though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment . The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation . Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology ( the doctrine of how the church as a body works ) , they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers , compared to the Catholics ' idea that certain people within the church , or ideas that were old enough , had a special status in giving understanding of the text .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's " Rational Clinical Examination Series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11-20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64-0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64-0.88 ) .
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence . During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones . Almost nothing of them survived except the " Ascension of Christ " in the Latin Chapel ( now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics ) . More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ , Councils of the Church and angels . In the apses the Annunciation , the Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen . The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor , the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church .
Eisenhower , as well as the officers and troops under him , had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations , and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault . His first struggles , however , were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion ; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord . Admiral Ernest J . King fought with Eisenhower over King 's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific . He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord , to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented , as he did . Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter 's concern with civilian casualties ; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans , and Eisenhower prevailed . He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton , by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate , and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy .
Each of Rome 's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic . Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests . The first " outsider " Etruscan king , Lucius Tarquinius Priscus , founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter , Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world . The benevolent , divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League , its Aventine Temple to Diana , and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms . Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus , whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates .
Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances . Some rituals specifically required the presence of women , but their active participation was limited . As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice , the central rite of most major public ceremonies . In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals , some cult practices were reserved for women only . The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely . Because women enter the public record less frequently than men , their religious practices are less known , and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias . A host of deities , however , are associated with motherhood . Juno , Diana , Lucina , and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent .
The synagogue in Eshtemoa ( As-Samu ) was built around the 4th century . The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns . The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya ( excavated in 1971–72 , founded in the end of the 4th century ) has three mosaic panels , the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine , two menorahs , a lulav and an etrog with columns , deer and rams . The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion’s den . The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels . The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center . It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community .
The first amendment to the US Constitution states " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " The two parts , known as the " establishment clause " and the " free exercise clause " respectively , form the textual basis for the Supreme Court 's interpretations of the " separation of church and state " doctrine . Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America 's doctrine for church-state separation : no coercion in religious matters , no expectation to support a religion against one 's will , and religious liberty encompasses all religions . In sum , citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith , any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary , and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan . It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books . English , Nepali , Sanskrit , Hindi , and Nepal Bhasa books are found here . The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD . Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library , located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building . This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana . It covers a wide range of subjects including history , law , art , religion , and philosophy , as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra , which is believed to be over 1,000 years old . The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building , and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639 . The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various European countries ( particularly Ireland , Germany and Italy ) and later from the Caribbean region ( particularly Puerto Rico , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic ) , as well as African American migrants from the American South . This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow . Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America ( the Western Interior Seaway ) and Europe , then receded late in the period , leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds . At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression , one-third of Earth 's present land area was submerged . The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk ; indeed , more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic . Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather , the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium ; this made the oceans more saturated , as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton . These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine . Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas 's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation . Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China . In the area that is now India , massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed . The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium ( often adhesive-backed paper , sticky plastic or soft lime or putty ) as it will appear when installed . When the mosaic is complete , a similar medium is placed atop it . The piece is then turned over , the original underlying material is carefully removed , and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above . In comparison to the indirect method , this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator , to avoid damaging the work . Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work , which is important e.g . when the human figure is involved . This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use ( patent n. 0000222556 ) under the name of his company , Sicis International Srl , now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl .
The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople . Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels , the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia . They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites . The esonarthex has two fluted domes , specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ . The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos . The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban , offering the model of the church to Christ . The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ . These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings , landscapes , figures .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
They can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as Brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . A " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in South Africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support some church , but this was more often Dutch Reformed , Quaker or Presbyterian , than Anglican . Some chose to support more than one church . He also ordained that the tax-payers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the Duke , as an openly divine-right Catholic , was no friend of Anglicanism . The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698 , though Anglicanism was more popular in New York .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from God , and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements . They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed . Jehovah 's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " The Witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah 's approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan . Witnesses are taught that association with " worldly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality .
Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children . He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law . The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights . Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation , they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875 .
In Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) , the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause . The court 's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable , " the court wrote . " Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a " wall , " is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "
Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries , most notably with Nicolas Delamare 's Traité de la Police ( " Treatise on the Police " ) , first published in 1705 . The German Polizeiwissenschaft ( Science of Police ) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police . Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften ( 1937 ) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however , this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault 's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850 .
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented . After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium , in a stone chamber " which had on a previous occasion [ 228 BC ] also been polluted by human victims , a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings " . Livy avoids the word " sacrifice " in connection with this bloodless human life-offering ; Plutarch does not . The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC , preparatory to an invasion of Gaul . Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain .
Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations , including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ , both in the United States and elsewhere . There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide , and the movement is growing in many parts of the world , especially the global South . Since the 1960s , Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions , and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement . Together , Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents .
Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas , although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers , rather than the madrasa itself , granted the license or degree . Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Hossein Nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval Islamic madrasahs became universities . George Makdisi and others , however , argue that the European university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world . Other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics .
In January 2010 , YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard . This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed . The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial . Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the H.264 or WebM formats could play the videos , and not all videos on the site were available .
Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis , Washington . In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce . In June 1941 , he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger , Commander of the 3rd Army , at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3 , 1941 . Although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
Contemporary humanism entails a qualified optimism about the capacity of people , but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely good or that all people can live up to the Humanist ideals without help . If anything , there is recognition that living up to one 's potential is hard work and requires the help of others . The ultimate goal is human flourishing ; making life better for all humans , and as the most conscious species , also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole . The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now , and leaving the world a better place for those who come after . In 1925 , the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned : " The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled ; and man , who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels , has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature . It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts " .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a " place of palaces " . There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur . The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , Kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty . The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square . The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap , Kumari Ghar , and Shiva-Parvati Temple ; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace . The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 Nepal earthquake .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures ; in principle , Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin , Etruscan and other Italian peoples , cults and deities as Roman . Those who acknowledged Rome 's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars , independent of Roman religious law . Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis . Autonomy and concord were official policy , but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models . Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages , especially to local elites . All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia . By the middle of the 1st century AD , Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established , Romanised cult nearby : by the end of that century , Sabratha’s so-called tophet was no longer in use . Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome 's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice , not a centralised legal requirement . Major cult centres to " non-Roman " deities continued to prosper : notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium , the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo 's sacred wood at Antioch .
Although the Reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . Since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most Protestant churches .
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .
In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede , Santa Maria in Domnica , Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura , Santa Cecilia in Trastevere , Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano . The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics . They were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . Another great work of Pope Leo , the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna , depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side , and SS . Susanna and Felicity on the other . It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . Pope Paschal I ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
Officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " The practice was a mark of the " Other " , attributed to Rome 's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls . Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain . Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere .
Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials . They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas , once common in the Eastern Mediterranean . The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham 's Palace , Palestine which was made around 744 . The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer ( right side ) and two deers peacefully grazing ( left side ) . The panel probably represents good and bad governance . Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar , Lebanon . The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat ( in present-day Jordan ) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill . The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by " good " animals on one side and " bad " animals on the other . Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls , grapes , pomegranates , oryx , wolves , hares , a leopard , pairs of partridges , fish , bulls , ostriches , rabbits , rams , goats , lions and a snake . At Qastal , near Amman , excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan , dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ( 685–705 ) . They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor . The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns , trees , animals , fruits and rosettes . Except for the open courtyard , entrance and staircases , the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics .
All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge , and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions . Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends . The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts .
Despite the lack of a coastline , Punjab is the most industrialised province of Pakistan ; its manufacturing industries produce textiles , sports goods , heavy machinery , electrical appliances , surgical instruments , vehicles , auto parts , metals , sugar mill plants , aircraft , cement , agricultural machinery , bicycles and rickshaws , floor coverings , and processed foods . In 2003 , the province manufactured 90 % of the paper and paper boards , 71 % of the fertilizers , 69 % of the sugar and 40 % of the cement of Pakistan .
Counting shipping as quasi-exports and in terms of monetary value , Greece ranked 4th globally in 2011 having " exported " shipping services worth 17,704.132 million $ ; only Denmark , Germany and South Korea ranked higher during that year . Similarly counting shipping services provided to Greece by other countries as quasi-imports and the difference between " exports " and " imports " as a " trade balance " , Greece in 2011 ranked in the latter second behind Germany , having " imported " shipping services worth 7,076.605 million US $ and having run a " trade surplus " of 10,712.342 million US $ .
The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south , although the northern ( primarily Germany , France and Great Britain ) and southern universities ( primarily Italy ) did have many elements in common . Latin was the language of the university , used for all texts , lectures , disputations and examinations . Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic , natural philosophy , and metaphysics ; while Hippocrates , Galen , and Avicenna were used for medicine . Outside of these commonalities , great differences separated north and south , primarily in subject matter . Italian universities focused on law and medicine , while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology . There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus , so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means . There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities . English , French and German universities usually awarded bachelor 's degrees , with the exception of degrees in theology , for which the doctorate was more common . Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates . The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions , while in the south students often went on to professional positions . The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris . Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna . Among the southern universities , a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy , which followed the pattern of Bologna as a " self-regulating , independent corporation of scholars " and those of southern Italy and Iberia , which were " founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government . "
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .

The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
Consistent with Calvin 's political ideas , Protestants created both the English and the American democracies . In seventeenth-century England , the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell , John Milton , John Locke , the Glorious Revolution , the English Bill of Rights , and the Act of Settlement . Later , the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies , e.g . Australia , New Zealand , and India . In North America , Plymouth Colony ( Pilgrim Fathers ; 1620 ) and Massachusetts Bay Colony ( 1628 ) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers . These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God . The Mayflower Compact was a social contract .
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950 , the hotel industry drastically improved . Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury such as the Hyatt Regency , Dwarika 's , theYak & Yeti , The Everest Hotel , Hotel Radisson , Hotel De L'Annapurna , The Malla Hotel , Shangri-La Hotel ( which is not operated by the Shangri-La Hotel Group ) and The Shanker Hotel . There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali , Hotel Narayani , The Blue Star and Grand Hotel . The Garden Hotel , Hotel Ambassador , and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu . Hotels like Hyatt Regency , De L'Annapurna and Hotel Yak & Yeti are among the five-star hotels providing casinos as well .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
Jefferson 's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case Reynolds v. U.S. , in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison , seeking a legal definition for the word religion . Writing for the majority , Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson 's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that " Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion , but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . " Considering this , the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( Tennessee Constitution Article IX , Section 2 is one such example . ) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me God . " In some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . At one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later Middle Ages and the Early Modern period . The 19th-century German historian Georg Voigt ( 1827–91 ) identified Petrarch as the first Renaissance humanist . Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was " the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness " . According to Petrarch , what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors . For Petrarch and Boccaccio , the greatest master was Cicero , whose prose became the model for both learned ( Latin ) and vernacular ( Italian ) prose .
Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis , Washington . In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce . In June 1941 , he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger , Commander of the 3rd Army , at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3 , 1941 . Although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
Kathmandu Metropolitan City ( KMC ) , in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat ( IRC ) . KMC 's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene , Oregon , United States . This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities : Motsumoto City of Japan , Rochester of the USA , Yangon ( formerly Rangoon ) of Myanmar , Xi'an of the People 's Republic of China , Minsk of Belarus , and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea . KMC 's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries , other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu .
Between 2005 and 2011 , Greece has had the highest percentage increase in industrial output compared to 2005 levels out of all European Union members , with an increase of 6 % . Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010 , with domestic output decreasing by 5.8 % and industrial production in general by 13.4 % . Currently , Greece is ranked third in the European Union in the production of marble ( over 920,000 tons ) , after Italy and Spain .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .
Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement . Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles , gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way ( via media ) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions . The English Reformation followed a particular course . The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII . King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome . In 1534 , the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . Between 1535 and 1540 , under Thomas Cromwell , the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect . Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I , a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I . The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition . The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other . It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Although the Reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . Since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most Protestant churches .
The Bronx has several local newspapers , including The Bronx News , Parkchester News , City News , The Riverdale Press , Riverdale Review , The Bronx Times Reporter , Inner City Press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and Co-Op City Times . Four non-profit news outlets , Norwood News , Mount Hope Monitor , Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough 's poorer communities . The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press , Bernard Stein , won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998 . ( Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959 . )
The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market , in the West Bronx , is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space , built on a 17 acres ( 7 ha ) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market , a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention , south of Yankee Stadium . The $ 500 million shopping center , which was completed in 2009 , saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings , one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market . The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars . The center has earned itself a LEED " Silver " designation in its design .
Kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . The average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley : south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City ( Patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by Kirtipur Municipality and to the east by Madyapur Thimi Municipality . To the north the urban area extends into several Village Development Committees . However , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church’s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
In 1953 , the Republican Party 's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch ; however , the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point . At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower 's presidency .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479 , Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood ( Santa Hermandad ) as a national police force . They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves , and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases . The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835 .
There are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos ( 1122–34 ) . The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name , Piroska shows . The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier ( from 1122 ) is similarly personal . The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty , the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed . The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent . There is only a " Communion of the Apostles " in the apse of the cathedral of Serres .
In the following century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art ( see details in Ravenna section ) . Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century . In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo , mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah ; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors , naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion . The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio , which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century , although it was restored many times later . The baptistery of the basilica , which was demolished in the 15th century , had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae , large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated . In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro , now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio , every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century . Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome , while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background . The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft , according to Foucault the police had an administrative , economic and social duty ( " procuring abundance " ) . It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d'état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population ( and unwittingly supervising the population ) , which , according to mercantilist theory , was to be the main strength of the state . Thus , its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns , urban planning ( which was important because of the miasma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . ) , and surveillance of prices .
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( Ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian . Geologically , the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . Throughout the early Paleozoic , the Earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea , which included most of the Earth 's land area .
Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions , many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx . The New York City Department of Education manages public noncharter schools in the borough . In 2000 , public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx 's residents over 3 years old ( out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools ) . There are also several public charter schools . Private schools range from élite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
The humanists ' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods . By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin , they applied the principle of ad fontes , or back to the sources , across broad areas of learning , seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors . In 1439 , while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon ( at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States ) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis , now called philology , to prove that the Donation of Constantine , which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome , was an 8th-century forgery . For the next 70 years , however , neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way . Instead , after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453 , which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy , humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism , hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches , and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world . The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts , not only of Plato and Aristotle , but also of the Christian Gospels , previously unavailable in the Latin West .
The capital and largest city is Lahore which was the historical capital of the wider Punjab region . Other important cities include Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Gujranwala , Sargodha , Multan , Sialkot , Bahawalpur , Gujrat , Sheikhupura , Jhelum and Sahiwal . Undivided Punjab is home to six rivers , of which five flow through Pakistani Punjab . From west to east , these are : the Indus , Jhelum , Beas , Chenab , Ravi and Sutlej . Nearly 60 % of Pakistan 's population lives in the Punjab . It is the nation 's only province that touches every other province ; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad . In the acronym P-A-K-I-S-T-A-N , the P is for Punjab .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .

During the Permian all the Earth 's major land masses , except portions of East Asia , were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea . Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles , with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ( Panthalassa , the universal sea ) , and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana . The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink . A new ocean was growing on its southern end , the Tethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era . Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ( " continental climate " ) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns . Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of New York City in the state of New York , located south of Westchester County . Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River , as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens . Of the five boroughs , the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible , education on all levels got a strong boost . By the middle of the eighteenth century , the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent , in Scotland 65 per cent , and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write . Colleges and universities were founded . For example , the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later . About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century , including Yale ( 1701 ) . Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions , which they consider a violation of God 's law based on their interpretation of Acts 15:28 , 29 and other scriptures . Since 1961 the willing acceptance of a blood transfusion by an unrepentant member has been grounds for expulsion from the religion . Members are directed to refuse blood transfusions , even in " a life-or-death situation " . Jehovah 's Witnesses accept non-blood alternatives and other medical procedures in lieu of blood transfusions , and their literature provides information about non-blood medical procedures .
The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time , as individual scientists , associations and universities were vying for limited resources . There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public , or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities . Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors , and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions , they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors .
The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago . Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the Holocene . In addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene , and are still rising today . The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea . Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont , Quebec , Ontario and Michigan . Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin . Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea , including much of Finland . The region continues to rise , still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe . The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger , immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase , to near its present boundaries .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma . During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana . Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and , as the period progressed , drifted toward the South Pole . Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents ( since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier ) , but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period , causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them . Also , Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia . The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this . By the end of the period , Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated .
Davies identifies Paine 's The Age of Reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical , historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach . " The first is political , largely French in inspiration , and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty ' . The second is philosophical , German , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . Homo homini deus est ( " The human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , Feuerbach had written .
Many scholars ( including Makdisi ) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus , the Emirate of Sicily , and the Middle East ( during the Crusades ) . Other scholars see this argument as overstated . Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education , turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
The last three years of Eisenhower 's second term in office were ones of relatively good health . Eventually after leaving the White House , he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks . A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs . In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis , for which he underwent surgery on December 12 , 1966 , when his gallbladder was removed , containing 16 gallstones . After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 ( see below ) , an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma , a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease . Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death .
In 1957 , the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision . Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order . When Faubus balked , the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division . They escorted and protected nine black students ' entry to Little Rock Central High School , an all-white public school , for the first time since the Reconstruction Era . Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions , writing " The overwhelming majority of southerners , Negro and white , stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock " .
Penny Marshall 's 1990 film Awakenings , which was nominated for several Oscars , is based on neurologist Oliver Sacks ' 1973 account of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of encephalitis but briefly responded to the drug L-dopa . Robin Williams played the physician ; Robert De Niro was one of the patients who emerged from a catatonic ( frozen ) state . The home of Williams ' character was shot not far from Sacks ' actual City Island residence . A 1973 Yorkshire Television documentary and " A Kind of Alaska " , a 1985 play by Harold Pinter , were also based on Sacks ' book .
In 1913 the Zliten mosaic , a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests , hunting and everyday life , was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten . In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna , Libya , uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD . The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer , four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground , and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue , staring at his slain opponent . The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa . The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a " masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii . "
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
The greatest mosaic work of the Palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the Chora Church in Constantinople . Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels , the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia . They were executed around 1320 by the command of Theodore Metochites . The esonarthex has two fluted domes , specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ . The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos . The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban , offering the model of the church to Christ . The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ . These panels show the influence of the Italian trecento on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings , landscapes , figures .
By contrast , Tom Wolfe 's Bonfire of the Vanities ( 1987 ) portrays a wealthy , white protagonist , Sherman McCoy , getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals . A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse . However , times change , and in 2007 , the New York Times reported that " the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman 's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments . " In the same article , the Reverend Al Sharpton ( whose fictional analogue in the novel is " Reverend Bacon " ) asserts that " twenty years later , the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe 's wardrobe . "
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy . Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent . Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments , such as the compound light microscope , or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope . Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification . Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen . A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells . This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases , where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly .
While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world , Armenians ( especially in the diaspora ) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations . These include the Armenian Catholic Church ( which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the Roman Catholic Pope ) , the Armenian Evangelical Church , which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away , and the Armenian Brotherhood Church , which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church , but later broke apart from it . There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds .

On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century . Among the rare examples are the 6th-century Christ in majesty ( or Ezekiel 's Vision ) mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times . Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church , which were made between 634 and 730 , also escaped destruction . Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki , often with suppliants before him .
Although Egypt was a majority Christian country before the 7th Century , after Islam arrived , the country was slowly Islamified to become a majority Muslim country . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings , individually and collectively , and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence ( rationalism , empiricism ) over acceptance of dogma or superstition . The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it . Generally , however , humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress . In modern times , humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism , and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world .
Haruspicy was also used in public cult , under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate . The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice , particularly the liver . They also interpreted omens , prodigies and portents , and formulated their expiation . Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient , ethnically Etruscan " outsider " religious profession , separate from Rome 's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy , essential but never quite respectable . During the mid-to-late Republic , the reformist Gaius Gracchus , the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla , and the " notorious Verres " justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners . The senate and armies used the public haruspices : at some time during the late Republic , the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination . Being of independent means , they would be better motivated to maintain a pure , religious practice for the public good . The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect : none of this seems to have troubled Marius , who employed a Syrian prophetess .
The Bronx street grid is irregular . Like the northernmost part of upper Manhattan , the West Bronx 's hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid . Much of the West Bronx 's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan , but does not match it exactly ; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx . This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx River , was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside .
In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation , the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough . Radical Reformer , Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt , for example , referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the " new papists " . Since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes . A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut , although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
Greece 's rail network is estimated to be at 2,548 km . Rail transport in Greece is operated by TrainOSE , a subsidiary of the Hellenic Railways Organization ( OSE ) . Most of the country 's network is standard gauge ( 1,565 km ) , while the country also has 983 km of narrow gauge . A total of 764 km of rail are electrified . Greece has rail connections with Bulgaria , the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey . A total of three suburban railway systems ( Proastiakos ) are in operation ( in Athens , Thessaloniki and Patras ) , while one metro system is operational in Athens with another under construction .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman religio . The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons , the apparent shrinking of the sun 's disc , two moons in a daylit sky , a cosmic battle between sun and moon , a rain of red-hot stones , a bloody sweat on statues , and blood in fountains and on ears of corn : all were expiated by sacrifice of " greater victims " . The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural ; sheep become goats , a hen become a cock ( and vice versa ) – these were expiated with " lesser victims " . The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina , singing a hymn to avert disaster : a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation . Religious restitution is proved only by Rome 's victory .
The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world . In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state , while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay . In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town , while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world , and may provide university accommodation for their students .
According to the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-Hispanic Black or African American , 10.9 % of the population was non-Hispanic White , 3.4 % non-Hispanic Asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-Hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-Hispanic ) . The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
Small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside of Armenia for centuries . For example , a community has existed for over a millennium in the Holy Land , and one of the four quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem has been called the Armenian Quarter . An Armenian Catholic monastic community of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near Venice , Italy . There are also remnants of formerly populous communities in India , Myanmar , Thailand , Belgium , Portugal , Italy , Poland , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria , Romania , Serbia , Ethiopia , Sudan and Egypt .

The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( " all the sea " ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean . The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age ; in the U.S. , these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup . Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass , Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in Western Europe , where the Triassic was first studied . In North America , for example , marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west . Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments , such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks . The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets , saints and patriarchs . Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an Emperor kneeling before Christ ( late 9th or early 10th century ) . Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine . Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand . Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded . A mosaic panel on the gallery shows Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe ( 1042–1055 ) . The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church .
The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make , promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods . Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus ; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson , all bearing the same name , also devoted themselves . Before the battle , Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate . When he offers sacrifice , the victim 's liver appears " damaged where it refers to his own fortunes " . Otherwise , the haruspex tells him , the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods . In a prayer recorded by Livy , Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus , charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks , and is killed ; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering . Had he failed to die , his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void , with possibly disastrous consequences . The act of devotio is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator .
The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris , then the largest city in Europe . The royal edict , registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15 , 1667 created the office of lieutenant général de police ( " lieutenant general of police " ) , who was to be the head of the new Paris police force , and defined the task of the police as " ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals , purging the city of what may cause disturbances , procuring abundance , and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties " .
From the 9th to 11th century , Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of Lake Van , this included both traditional styles and new innovations . Ornately carved Armenian Khachkars were developed during this time . Many new cities and churches were built during this time , including a new capital at Lake Van and a new Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match . The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty . It was during this time that the first major monasteries , such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were built . This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion .
Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra , composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran . Zarathustra 's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda ( God in the form of supreme wisdom ) . The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices , made freely in this present life , in the afterlife . The importance placed on thought , action , responsibility , and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by , and inspired a number of , Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu .
In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation , Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion . These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom . In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Latvia , Estonia and Hungary , it remains one of the most popular religions . Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements , there are only few Protestant adherents ; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs , restrictions during the Communist rule , and also the ongoing secularization . Over the last several decades , religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased . According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer , Protestants made up 12 % of the EU population . According to Pew Research Center , Protestants constituted nearly one fifth ( or 17.8 % ) of the continent 's Christian population in 2010 . Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15 % of all Europeans in 2009 , while Noll claims that less than 12 % of them lived in Europe in 2010 .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
Several countries have established their national churches , linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state . Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries ; Denmark ( including Greenland ) , the Faroe Islands ( its church being independent since 2007 ) , Iceland and Norway have established Evangelical Lutheran churches . Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world , while Tonga—in the Methodist tradition . The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England , and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Praça dos Três Poderes ( Portuguese for Square of the Three Powers ) is a plaza in Brasília . The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza : the Executive , represented by the Palácio do Planalto ( presidential office ) ; the Legislative , represented by the National Congress ( Congresso Nacional ) ; and the Judicial branch , represented by the Supreme Federal Court ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) . It is a tourist attraction in Brasília , designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously .
In 1566 , the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited . By the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . On July 9 , 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order . In 1808 , the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil , because of the French invasion of Portugal . King João VI established the " Intendência Geral de Polícia " ( General Police Intendancy ) for investigations . He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809 . In 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 .
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . The size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world . Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music . In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called " kef " style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular . This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated . Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional " kef " style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of " kef music " heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time . Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia . Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry . Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan . Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent . In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .
Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
Football and Cricket are the most popular sports among the younger generation in Nepal and there are several stadiums in the city . The sport is governed by the All Nepal Football Association ( ANFA ) from its headquarters in Kathmandu . The only international football stadium in the city is the Dasarath Rangasala Stadium , a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for football matches and cultural events , located in the neighborhood of Tripureshwor . It is the largest stadium in Nepal with a capacity of 25,000 spectators , built in 1956 . Martyr 's Memorial League is also held in this ground every year . The stadium was renovated with Chinese help before the 8th South Asian Games were held in Kathmandu and had floodlights installed . Kathmandu is home to the oldest football clubs of Nepal such as RCT , Sankata and NRT . Other prominent clubs include MMC , Machhindra FC , Tribhuwan Army Club ( TAC ) and MPC .

Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent . Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a microbe in a community , and other epidemiological considerations . Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower , Nikita Khrushchev , Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident . Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev 's demands that he apologize . Therefore , Khrushchev would not take part in the summit . Up until this event , Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union . Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit . Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that " stupid U-2 business " .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
Colloquially , the term university may be used to describe a phase in one 's life : " When I was at university ... " ( in the United States and Ireland , college is often used instead : " When I was in college ... " ) . In Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Nigeria , the Netherlands , Spain and the German-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni . In Ghana , New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called " varsity " ( although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years ) . " Varsity " was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] " Varsity " is still in common usage in Scotland .
In the 6th century BCE , Taoist teacher Lao Tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . The Silver Rule of Confucianism from Analects XV.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . Humanistic thought is also contained in other Confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in Zuo Zhuan , Ji Liang says , " People is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . So , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; Neishi Guo says , " Gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " Taoist and Confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .
The second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . Though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers . Because sola scriptura placed the Bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between Christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was Christocentric .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
The Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century . One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist . Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation , which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body , blood , soul , and divinity of Christ . They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion .
Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages . The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
Over New York City in 1953 , Eastern Airlines Flight 8610 , a commercial flight , had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610 , a Lockheed C-121 Constellation known as Columbine II , while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower . This prompted the adoption of the unique call sign Air Force One , to be used whenever the president is on board any US Air Force aircraft . Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display .
As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world , their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them , since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability . One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage , building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion . Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities , including dedications made by Romans to local gods . By the height of the Empire , numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces , among them Cybele , Isis , Epona , and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus , found as far north as Roman Britain . Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only , religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems . The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions , but sometimes to intractable conflict . For example , religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt .
In 1953 , the Republican Party 's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch ; however , the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point . At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower 's presidency .
The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639 . The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various European countries ( particularly Ireland , Germany and Italy ) and later from the Caribbean region ( particularly Puerto Rico , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic ) , as well as African American migrants from the American South . This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop .
The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful . In the early days of Rome 's war against Carthage , the commander Publius Claudius Pulcher ( consul 249 BC ) launched a sea campaign " though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices . " In defiance of the omen , he threw them into the sea , " saying that they might drink , since they would not eat . He was defeated , and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator , he appointed his messenger Glycias , as if again making a jest of his country 's peril . " His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
Among Ike 's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) into McCarthy 's witch hunt for communists , which would interfere with , and perhaps delay , the AEC 's important work on H-bombs . The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC , J. Robert Oppenheimer , had urged that the H-bomb work be delayed . Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance , though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy .
The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of New York City in the state of New York , located south of Westchester County . Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River , as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens . Of the five boroughs , the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . Deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : Juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; Jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . Di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as Mars , Janus , Neptune and various genii – including the Emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . After the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . Rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .

In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation , the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough . Radical Reformer , Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt , for example , referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the " new papists " . Since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes . A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut , although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
Kathmandu ( /ˌkɑːtmɑːnˈduː/ ; Nepali pronunciation : [ kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu ] ) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal . It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar ( Metropolitan City ) , as compared to Upa-Mahanagar ( Sub-Metropolitan City ) or Nagar ( City ) . Kathmandu is the core of Nepal 's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi , Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities . Kathmandu is also known informally as " KTM " or the " tri-city " . According to the 2011 census , Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures 49.45 km2 ( 19.09 sq mi ) .
Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled , working-class , urban culture . Hollywood films such as From This Day Forward ( 1946 ) , set in Highbridge , occasionally delved into Bronx life . Paddy Chayefsky 's Academy Award-winning Marty was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film The Catered Affair , and in the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri film , A Bronx Tale , Spike Lee 's 1999 movie Summer of Sam , centered in an Italian-American Bronx community , 1994 's I Like It Like That that takes place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx , and Doughboys , the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother 's gambling debts .
Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is : in whose interest is it ? At a more practical level , the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable ( Sheptycki , 2004 ) . For example , according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 ( Lloyd , et al . 2007 ) Interpol had the lowest scores in its category ( IGOs ) , coming in tenth with a score of 22 % on overall accountability capabilities ( p. 19 ) . As this report points out , and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm , this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement .
The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan . It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books . English , Nepali , Sanskrit , Hindi , and Nepal Bhasa books are found here . The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD . Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library , located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building . This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana . It covers a wide range of subjects including history , law , art , religion , and philosophy , as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra , which is believed to be over 1,000 years old . The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building , and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated .
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 .

The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide , Protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the Anglican Communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former Prussian Union of churches ) . Nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
The Taragaon Museum presents the modern history of the Kathmandu Valley . It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley , documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century . The actual structure of the Museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu . It was designed by Carl Pruscha ( master-planner of the Kathmandy Valley ) in 1970 and constructed in 1971 . Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon hostel into the Taragaon Museum . The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements , as well as the use of circle , triangles and squares . The Museum is within a short walk from the Boudhnath stupa , which itself can be seen from the Museum tower .
On the other hand , in his study on nine of " the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world " , Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn , Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University , wrote : “The NW [ New World Translation ] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators , BeDuhn stated : “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal , conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament " violate [ s ] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God " .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available . The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable . The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) . These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins . A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Serological methods are highly sensitive , specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms . These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen . The antigen , usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent , is bound by the antibody . This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways , dependent upon the test . For example , " Strep throat " is often diagnosed within minutes , and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent , S. pyogenes , that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab . Serological tests , if available , are usually the preferred route of identification , however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration . Some serological methods are extremely costly , although when commonly used , such as with the " strep test " , they can be inexpensive .
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
In the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one party , the Speaker normally assumes a lower profile and defers to the President . For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a de facto " leader of the opposition " , often more so than the Senate Minority Leader , due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership . Minority Leaders who have played prominent roles in opposing the incumbent President have included Gerald Ford , Richard Gephardt , Nancy Pelosi , and John Boehner .
Among the Punjabi poets , the names of Sultan Bahu , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Baksh , and Waris Shah and folk singers like Inayat Hussain Bhatti and Tufail Niazi , Alam Lohar , Sain Marna , Mansoor Malangi , Allah Ditta Lona wala , Talib Hussain Dard , Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi , Gamoo Tahliwala , Mamzoo Gha-lla , Akbar Jat , Arif Lohar , Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known . In the composition of classical ragas , there are such masters as Malika-i-Mauseequi ( Queen of Music ) Roshan Ara Begum , Ustad Amanat Ali Khan , Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan . Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature , by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979 .
The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market , in the West Bronx , is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space , built on a 17 acres ( 7 ha ) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market , a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention , south of Yankee Stadium . The $ 500 million shopping center , which was completed in 2009 , saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings , one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market . The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars . The center has earned itself a LEED " Silver " designation in its design .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic : opus vermiculatum used tiny tesserae , typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less , and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support . The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail , and an approach to the illusionism of painting . Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work . The normal technique was opus tessellatum , using larger tesserae , which was laid on site . There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background , which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work .
Institute of Medicine , the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is located in Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . It was established in 1972 and started to impart medical education from 1978 . A number of medical colleges including Kathmandu Medical College , Nepal Medical College , KIST Medical College , Nepal Army Institute of Health Sciences , National Academy of Medical Sciences ( NAMS ) and Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences ( KUSMS ) , are also located in or around Kathmandu .
In the late 1130s , Arnold of Brescia , an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church . After his death , his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists , and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans , though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation . In the early 1170s , Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians . He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church . By 1215 , the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution . Despite that , the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy , as a part of the wider Reformed tradition .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005 . The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in September 2005 . Following a $ 3.5 million investment from Sequoia Capital in November , the site launched officially on December 15 , 2005 , by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day . The site grew rapidly , and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day , and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day . According to data published by market research company comScore , YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States , with a market share of around 43 % and more than 14 billion views of videos in May 2010 .
Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors : the Central Sector , the East Sector , the North Sector , the City Core and the West Sector . For civic administration , the city is further divided into 35 administrative wards . The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members . It holds biannual meetings to review , process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions . The ward 's profile documents for the 35 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population , the structure and condition of houses , the type of roads , educational , health and financial institutions , entertainment facilities , parking space , security provisions , etc . It also includes lists of development projects completed , on-going and planned , along with informative data about the cultural heritage , festivals , historical sites and the local inhabitants . Ward 16 is the largest , with an area of 437.4 ha ; ward 26 is the smallest , with an area of 4 ha .
Witnesses believe that a " little flock " go to heaven , but that the hope for life after death for the majority of " other sheep " involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon . They interpret Revelation 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000 , who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth . Jehovah 's Witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon , but that God is the final judge . During Christ 's millennial reign , most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever ; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium .
Rome 's government , politics and religion were dominated by an educated , male , landowning military aristocracy . Approximately half Rome 's population were slave or free non-citizens . Most others were plebeians , the lowest class of Roman citizens . Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights ; far fewer could actually exercise them . Women had no vote . However , all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices , in the name of the senate and people of Rome . " In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine , just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans " .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .
The Armenians collective has , at times , constituted a Christian " island " in a mostly Muslim region . There is , however , a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims , known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race , while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years . The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States . Later on , the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin , the original seat of the Catholicosate . In 1441 , a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi , while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia . Therefore , since 1441 , there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges , and with their respective jurisdictions . The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia .
The Armenian Highland lies in the highlands surrounding Mount Ararat , the highest peak of the region . In the Bronze Age , several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia , including the Hittite Empire ( at the height of its power ) , Mitanni ( South-Western historical Armenia ) , and Hayasa-Azzi ( 1600–1200 BC ) . Soon after Hayasa-Azzi were Arme-Shupria ( 1300s–1190 BC ) , the Nairi ( 1400–1000 BC ) and the Kingdom of Urartu ( 860–590 BC ) , who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland . Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people . Under Ashurbanipal ( 669–627 BC ) , the Assyrian empire reached the Caucasus Mountains ( modern Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan ) .
In November 2008 , 720p HD support was added . At the time of the 720p launch , the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9 . With this new feature , YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format . In November 2009 , 1080p HD support was added . In July 2010 , YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format , which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels . In June 2015 , support for 8K resolution was added , with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels .
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures ; in principle , Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin , Etruscan and other Italian peoples , cults and deities as Roman . Those who acknowledged Rome 's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars , independent of Roman religious law . Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis . Autonomy and concord were official policy , but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models . Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages , especially to local elites . All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia . By the middle of the 1st century AD , Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established , Romanised cult nearby : by the end of that century , Sabratha’s so-called tophet was no longer in use . Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome 's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice , not a centralised legal requirement . Major cult centres to " non-Roman " deities continued to prosper : notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium , the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo 's sacred wood at Antioch .

According to a story that has often been repeated in the media , Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005 , after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen 's apartment in San Francisco . Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred , but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party " was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible " .
The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower 's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency . Meanwhile , Columbia University 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including Leonard McCollum , the president of Continental Oil ; Frank Abrams , the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey ; Bob Kleberg , the president of the King Ranch ; H. J. Porter , a Texas oil executive ; Bob Woodruff , the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation ; and Clarence Francis , the chairman of General Foods .
The Church of the Holy Apostles in Thessaloniki was built in 1310–14 . Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern . Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in Arta . The church was established by the Despot of Epirus in 1294–96 . In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .
The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks . The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets , saints and patriarchs . Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an Emperor kneeling before Christ ( late 9th or early 10th century ) . Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine . Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand . Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded . A mosaic panel on the gallery shows Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe ( 1042–1055 ) . The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church .
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible , education on all levels got a strong boost . By the middle of the eighteenth century , the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent , in Scotland 65 per cent , and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write . Colleges and universities were founded . For example , the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later . About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century , including Yale ( 1701 ) . Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning .
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .
Active in the early 1920s , F.C.S . Schiller labelled his work " humanism " but for Schiller the term referred to the pragmatist philosophy he shared with William James . In 1929 , Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley , John Dewey , Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann . Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife , Clara Cook Potter , published Humanism : A New Religion . Throughout the 1930s , Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as , women’s rights , access to birth control , " civil divorce laws " , and an end to capital punishment .

Jefferson 's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case Reynolds v. U.S. , in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison , seeking a legal definition for the word religion . Writing for the majority , Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson 's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that " Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion , but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . " Considering this , the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
During the Reformation , the term was hardly used outside of the German politics . The word evangelical ( German : evangelisch ) , which refers to the gospel , was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement . Nowadays , this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations , above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD . The German word evangelisch means Protestant , and is different from the German evangelikal , which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism . The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches , and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole . It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England , where Evangelicalism originated , and then was brought to the United States . The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German , and is different from English reformed ( German : reformiert ) , which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians .
Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured . All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host . An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin . Neither of these colonizations are considered infections . The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance . Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions , and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection . Some colonizing bacteria , such as Corynebacteria sp . and viridans streptococci , prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host , preventing infection and speeding wound healing .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .

According to Der Spiegel , credits given to European governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives . A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that " The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " In previous years , Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank . " These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines . In May 2010 , the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and Great Britain third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP during 2010 .
In November 1945 , Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army . His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . However , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets , Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon . Indeed , Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese , writing , " First , the Japanese were ready to surrender and it was n't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . Second , I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " Initially , Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets . He even visited Warsaw in 1945 . Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . However , by mid-1947 , as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated , Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion .
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends . According to Swayambhu Purana , present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake names " Nagdaha " as it was full of snakes . The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa Manjusri with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land . After sometimes , a demon named Banasur closed the outlet and the valley was again a lake . Then lots Krishna came to Nepal , killed Banasur and again drained out water . He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples ( such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription ) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters ' territories , and which later became a kingdom . At its zenith ( 95–65 BC ) , the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey , Lebanon , and northern Iran . The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples .
In 2010 Piraeus handled 513,319 TEUs , followed by Thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 TEUs . In the same year , 83.9 million people passed through Greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of Paloukia in Salamis , another 12.7 through the port of Perama , 9.5 million through Piraeus and 2.7 million through Igoumenitsa . In 2013 , Piraeus handled a record 3.16 million TEUs , the third-largest figure in the Mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through Pier II , owned by COSCO and 644,000 were transported through Pier I , owned by the Greek state .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
The synagogue in Eshtemoa ( As-Samu ) was built around the 4th century . The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns . The synagogue in Khirbet Susiya ( excavated in 1971–72 , founded in the end of the 4th century ) has three mosaic panels , the eastern one depicting a Torah shrine , two menorahs , a lulav and an etrog with columns , deer and rams . The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted Daniel in the lion’s den . The Roman synagogue in Ein Gedi was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels . The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center . It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community .
The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar , who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy ; he was murdered soon after . Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors , and offered similar cult to Caesar 's successor , Augustus , who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship ; it might prove fatal . By the end of his reign , Augustus had appropriated Rome 's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his " reformed " and thoroughly integrated system of government . Towards the end of his life , he cautiously allowed cult to his numen . By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed , first in the Eastern Provinces , then in the West . Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context ; bathhouses , shrines and temples to Roman and local deities , amphitheatres and festivals . In the early Imperial period , the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship .
In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway , 12-696 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings , which are allowed , must allow various faiths to lead prayer , or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian . On May 5 , 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings , but also for sectarian prayers like predominately Christian prayers .
As of June 2012 [ update ] , Pakistan 's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab . According to protesters , load shedding was depriving the cities of electricity 20–22 hours a day , causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard . Gujranwala , Toba Tek Singh , Faisalabad , Sialkot , Bahawalnagar and communities across Khanewal District saw widespread rioting and violence on Sunday 17 June 2012 , with the houses of several members of parliament being attacked as well as the offices of regional energy suppliers Fesco , Gepco and Mepco being ransacked or attacked .
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .
In January 1917 , the Watch Tower Society 's legal representative , Joseph Franklin Rutherford , was elected as its next president . His election was disputed , and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .
A central teaching of Jehovah 's Witnesses is that the current world era , or " system of things " , entered the " last days " in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ , leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably . They consider all other present-day religions to be false , identifying them with " Babylon the Great " , or the " harlot " , of Revelation 17 , and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations , which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17 . This development will mark the beginning of the " great tribulation " . Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah 's Witnesses , an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon , during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ 's " sheep " , or true followers , will be destroyed . After Armageddon , God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth , which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden . After Armageddon , most of those who had died before God 's intervention will gradually be resurrected during " judgment day " lasting for one thousand years . This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds . At the end of the thousand years , Christ will hand all authority back to God . Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind . Those who fail will be destroyed , along with Satan and his demons . The end result will be a fully tested , glorified human race .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
Quakers , or Friends , are members of a family of religious movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends . The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers . Many Friends view themselves as members of a Christian denomination . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity . Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity , the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures .
Rome 's government , politics and religion were dominated by an educated , male , landowning military aristocracy . Approximately half Rome 's population were slave or free non-citizens . Most others were plebeians , the lowest class of Roman citizens . Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights ; far fewer could actually exercise them . Women had no vote . However , all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices , in the name of the senate and people of Rome . " In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine , just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans " .
Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
During this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( Federalists and Democratic-Republicans ) had an official leader . In 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " In 1828 , a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on Capitol Hill :
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
The Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the President of Brazil . The palace was designed , along with the rest of the city of Brasília , by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958 . One of the first structures built in the republic 's new capital city , the " Alvorada " lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Paranoá . The principles of simplicity and modernity , that in the past characterized the great works of architecture , motivated Niemeyer . The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box , softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns . The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement , landing , and second floor . The auditorium , kitchen , laundry , medical center , and administration offices are at basement level . The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing . The second floor has four suites , two apartments , and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace . The building also has a library , a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool , a music room , two dining rooms and various meeting rooms . A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
Some legal scholars , such as John Baker of LSU , theorize that Madison 's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " —was rejected by the House , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists . To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown . During the debate over the establishment clause , Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison 's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government , such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates ( 2007 ) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video , with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape . Describing the Arab Spring ( 2010- ) , sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist 's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using " Facebook to schedule the protests , Twitter to coordinate , and YouTube to tell the world . " In 2012 , more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the " Kony 2012 " video was posted to YouTube , with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video " will do more to lead to ( Kony 's ) demise than all other action combined . "
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . The size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Protestants reject the Roman Catholic Church 's doctrine that it is the one true church , believing in the invisible church , which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ . Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations , and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others . Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences . Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs . Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith , non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant .
In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) , law , grammar and rhetoric . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum , while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship . The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs can not be underestimated . Once humanist professors joined the university faculty , they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction , to translate and interpret classical texts , and to live honorable lives . Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts , as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts . Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno , Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts . The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship . For instance , Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen , whose ideas he verified through his own dissections . In law , Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective , while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist . Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts , which was important for the reform at Protestant universities . Galileo Galilei , who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua , and Martin Luther , who taught at the University of Wittenberg ( as did Melanchthon ) , also had humanist training . The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university ; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs , syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship .
Dwight David " Ike " Eisenhower ( /ˈaɪzənˌhaʊ.ər/ EYE-zən-HOW-ər ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was an American politician and general who served as the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 . He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe . He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front . In 1951 , he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO .
On January 17 , 1961 , Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office . In his farewell speech , Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces . He described the Cold War : " We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ... " and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that " we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military–industrial complex . "
During Soviet rule , Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions . The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . In football , their most successful team was Yerevan 's FC Ararat , which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like FC Bayern Munich in the Euro cup .
Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual ; in effect they were Rome in miniature . The commander 's headquarters stood at the centre ; he took the auspices on a dais in front . A small building behind housed the legionary standards , the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era , the image of the ruling emperor . In one camp , this shrine is even called Capitolium . The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major , set battle . A ram , a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded , led around the outer perimeter of the camp ( a lustratio exercitus ) and in through a gate , then sacrificed : Trajan 's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars . The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum ; all within are purified and protected .
YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website . Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web . This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs . Users wishing to post a video discussing , inspired by or related to another user 's video are able to make a " video response " . On August 27 , 2013 , YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature . Embedding , rating , commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
The official published membership statistics , such as those mentioned above , include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry ; official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings . As a result , only about half of those who self-identified as Jehovah 's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself . The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion : about 37 % of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah 's Witnesses .
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
Active in the early 1920s , F.C.S . Schiller labelled his work " humanism " but for Schiller the term referred to the pragmatist philosophy he shared with William James . In 1929 , Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley , John Dewey , Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann . Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife , Clara Cook Potter , published Humanism : A New Religion . Throughout the 1930s , Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as , women’s rights , access to birth control , " civil divorce laws " , and an end to capital punishment .
Islamic architecture used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the Muslim conquests of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire . In Syria and Egypt the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art . During the Umayyad Dynasty mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of zellige and azulejo in various parts of the Arab world , although tile was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century , stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort : " The law of love , peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews , Turks and Egyptians , as they are considered sons of Adam , which is the glory of the outward state of Holland , so love , peace and liberty , extending to all in Christ Jesus , condemns hatred , war and bondage . " The document was signed December 27 , 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant . Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony , in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic . The signers indicated their " desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged , neither to condemn least we be condemned , but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master . " Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted . However , John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home . Bowne was arrested , jailed , and sent to the Netherlands for trial ; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne .
Kumari Ghar is a palace in the center of the Kathmandu city , next to the Durbar square where a Royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides . Kumari , or Kumari Devi , is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in South Asian countries . In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous . Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju ( the Nepali name for Durga ) until she menstruates , after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body . Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status . The current Royal Kumari , Matina Shakya , age four , was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .
Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century . Among the rare examples are the 6th-century Christ in majesty ( or Ezekiel 's Vision ) mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times . Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church , which were made between 634 and 730 , also escaped destruction . Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki , often with suppliants before him .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
Jefferson 's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity , but this was a caricature . In setting up the University of Virginia , Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own , though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity , arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom . Some have argued that this arrangement was " fully compatible with Jefferson 's views on the separation of church and state ; " however , others point to Jefferson 's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation . Still other scholars , such as Mark David Hall , attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history
After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . From that point on , Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution . During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century , “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms” , regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State , and therefore threatened its existence . The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism ; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework . Christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . By 1992 , with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe ( Joubert and Bevers , 1996 ) .
Public priests were appointed by the collegia . Once elected , a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine , which offered him lifetime influence , privilege and immunity . Therefore , civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family . Religious law was collegial and traditional ; it informed political decisions , could overturn them , and was difficult to exploit for personal gain . Priesthood was a costly honour : in traditional Roman practice , a priest drew no stipend . Cult donations were the property of the deity , whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds . For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum , permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime 's service in military or political life , or preferably both : it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty . For a freedman or slave , promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile , and opportunities in local politics ; and therefore business . During the Imperial era , priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office ; in effect , it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum . In Rome , the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren , once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities , then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms . The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays , accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt . Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year , provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions ( e.g. , influenza ) . Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted . Other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection , such as vector transmission or sexual transmission , are usually not regarded as " contagious " , and often do not require medical isolation ( sometimes loosely called quarantine ) of victims . However , this specialized connotation of the word " contagious " and " contagious disease " ( easy transmissibility ) is not always respected in popular use .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities , resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices . In one decade , the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001 . The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021 . To keep up this population growth , the KMC-controlled area of 5,076.6 hectares ( 12,545 acres ) has expanded to 8,214 hectares ( 20,300 acres ) in 2001 . With this new area , the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001 ; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021 .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
IMF 's forecast said that Greece 's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014 . But in fact , the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployemnt . The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009 , and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013 . In 2015 , Greece 's jobless rate is around 24 per cent . It is thought that Greece 's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
The Boudhanath , ( also written Bouddhanath , Bodhnath , Baudhanath or the Khāsa Chaitya ) , is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal , along with Swayambhu . It is a very popular tourist site . Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali . Located about 11 km ( 7 mi ) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu , the stupa 's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal . Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 .
In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway , 12-696 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings , which are allowed , must allow various faiths to lead prayer , or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian . On May 5 , 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings , but also for sectarian prayers like predominately Christian prayers .
Armenians constitute the main population of Armenia and the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic . There is a wide-ranging diaspora of around 5 million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside of modern Armenia . The largest Armenian populations today exist in Russia , the United States , France , Georgia , Iran , Ukraine , Lebanon , and Syria . With the exceptions of Iran and the former Soviet states , the present-day Armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the Armenian Genocide .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .

Eliot and her circle , who included her companion George Henry Lewes ( the biographer of Goethe ) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau , were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte , whom Martineau had translated . Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity ( which worshiped the dead , since most humans who have ever lived are dead ) , complete with holidays and liturgy , modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism . Although Comte 's English followers , like Eliot and Martineau , for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system , they liked the idea of a religion of humanity . Comte 's austere vision of the universe , his injunction to " vivre pour altrui " ( " live for others " , from which comes the word " altruism " ) , and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
With the abatement of persecution , St. Jerome acknowledged the Empire as a bulwark against evil but insisted that " imperial honours " were contrary to Christian teaching . His was an authoritative but minority voice : most Christians showed no qualms in the veneration of even " pagan " emperors . The peace of the emperors was the peace of God ; as far as the Church was concerned , internal dissent and doctrinal schism were a far greater problem . The solution came from a hitherto unlikely source : as pontifex maximus Constantine I favoured the " Catholic Church of the Christians " against the Donatists because :
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .

The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson ( later U.S. president ) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House , both from Texas . Joe Martin , the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that Eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . There were exceptions , Leonard W. Hall , for example , who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . However , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
He assumed duties again at Camp Meade , Maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . His schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton , Sereno E. Brett , and other senior tank leaders . Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
Football and Cricket are the most popular sports among the younger generation in Nepal and there are several stadiums in the city . The sport is governed by the All Nepal Football Association ( ANFA ) from its headquarters in Kathmandu . The only international football stadium in the city is the Dasarath Rangasala Stadium , a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for football matches and cultural events , located in the neighborhood of Tripureshwor . It is the largest stadium in Nepal with a capacity of 25,000 spectators , built in 1956 . Martyr 's Memorial League is also held in this ground every year . The stadium was renovated with Chinese help before the 8th South Asian Games were held in Kathmandu and had floodlights installed . Kathmandu is home to the oldest football clubs of Nepal such as RCT , Sankata and NRT . Other prominent clubs include MMC , Machhindra FC , Tribhuwan Army Club ( TAC ) and MPC .
European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( scholae monasticae ) , in which monks and nuns taught classes ; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century . The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools . It is possible , however , that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare , with the University of Paris being an exception . Later they were also founded by Kings ( University of Naples Federico II , Charles University in Prague , Jagiellonian University in Kraków ) or municipal administrations ( University of Cologne , University of Erfurt ) . In the early medieval period , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools , usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education . Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries .
The onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . June and July are oppressively hot . Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °C , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °C . In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . The hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late October .

In the American Old West , policing was often of very poor quality . [ citation needed ] The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organized posses . [ citation needed ] Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors , notably the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , which was hired by individuals , businessmen , local governments and the federal government . At its height , the Pinkerton Agency 's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army . [ citation needed ]
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building , as the supercontinent Pangea came together . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana , which collided with North America-Europe ( Laurussia ) along the present line of eastern North America . This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe , and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America ; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains . In the same time frame , much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains . There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys . Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean ( closed by the assembly of South and North America ) , the small , shallow Ural Ocean ( which was closed by the collision of Baltica , and Siberia continents , creating the Ural Mountains ) and Proto-Tethys Ocean .

In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening . The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it , and miraculously recovered , though he had to repeat his freshman year . He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college , though they lacked the funds . They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots . Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva . He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there . Despite heavy persecution , the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment . French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character , made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s . This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts , known as the French Wars of Religion . The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559 . Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time , illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of August 1572 , when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France . The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes , promising official toleration of the Protestant minority , but under highly restricted conditions . Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion , and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century , culminating in Louis XIV 's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again . In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau , Frederick William I , Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam , giving free passage to Huguenot refugees . In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England , the Netherlands , Prussia , Switzerland , and the English and Dutch overseas colonies . A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region .
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .
The last three years of Eisenhower 's second term in office were ones of relatively good health . Eventually after leaving the White House , he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks . A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs . In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis , for which he underwent surgery on December 12 , 1966 , when his gallbladder was removed , containing 16 gallstones . After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 ( see below ) , an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma , a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease . Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death .
Second , Democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status . Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern . In 1919 , for instance , Republicans bypassed James R. Mann , R-IL , who had been minority leader for eight years , and elected Frederick Gillett , R-MA , to be Speaker . Mann " had angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor ; " also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon , R-IL ( 1903–1911 ) , and many Members " suspected that he would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker . " More recently , although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections , he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign , including the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting day .

Users who have a good track record of complying with the site 's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length , which requires verifying the account , normally through a mobile phone . When YouTube was launched in 2005 , it was possible to upload long videos , but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films . The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010 . If an up-to-date browser version is used , videos greater than 20 GB can be uploaded .
Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis , Washington . In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce . In June 1941 , he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger , Commander of the 3rd Army , at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3 , 1941 . Although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . Some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia , and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber . Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the Bona Dea rites .
In 2010 Piraeus handled 513,319 TEUs , followed by Thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 TEUs . In the same year , 83.9 million people passed through Greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of Paloukia in Salamis , another 12.7 through the port of Perama , 9.5 million through Piraeus and 2.7 million through Igoumenitsa . In 2013 , Piraeus handled a record 3.16 million TEUs , the third-largest figure in the Mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through Pier II , owned by COSCO and 644,000 were transported through Pier I , owned by the Greek state .
When infection attacks the body , anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection . Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist , depending on the type of organism targeted ; they include antibacterial ( antibiotic ; including antitubercular ) , antiviral , antifungal and antiparasitic ( including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic ) agents . Depending on the severity and the type of infection , the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection , or may be applied topically . Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics . Sometimes , multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic . Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses . Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria . The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin , cephalosporins , aminoglycosides , macrolides , quinolones and tetracyclines . [ citation needed ]
As of 2010 , 46.29 % ( 584,463 ) of Bronx residents aged five and older spoke Spanish at home , while 44.02 % ( 555,767 ) spoke English , 2.48 % ( 31,361 ) African languages , 0.91 % ( 11,455 ) French , 0.90 % ( 11,355 ) Italian , 0.87 % ( 10,946 ) various Indic languages , 0.70 % ( 8,836 ) other Indo-European languages , and Chinese was spoken at home by 0.50 % ( 6,610 ) of the population over the age of five . In total , 55.98 % ( 706,783 ) of the Bronx 's population age five and older spoke a language at home other than English . A Garifuna-speaking community from Honduras and Guatemala also makes the Bronx its home .
Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of Latin , such as Cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the Greek equivalent Paideia . Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century Italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . Modern scholars , however , point out that Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . For Cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
Once the coastal assault had succeeded , Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy , and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany . Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group 's attack being made in the north , while Generals Bradley ( 12th U.S. Army Group ) and Devers ( Sixth U.S. Army Group ) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front ( respectively ) . Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces , often by giving them tactical , though sometimes ineffective , latitude ; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe . However , due to Eisenhower 's persistence , the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully , albeit belatedly , opened in late 1944 , and victory became a more distinct probability .
Juscelino Kubitschek , President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961 , ordered the construction of Brasília , fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise . Building Brasília was part of Juscelino 's " fifty years of prosperity in five " plan . Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 , with 5550 people competing . Oscar Niemeyer , a close friend , was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer . Brasília was built in 41 months , from 1956 to April 21 , 1960 , when it was officially inaugurated .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market , in the West Bronx , is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space , built on a 17 acres ( 7 ha ) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market , a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention , south of Yankee Stadium . The $ 500 million shopping center , which was completed in 2009 , saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings , one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market . The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars . The center has earned itself a LEED " Silver " designation in its design .
According to Der Spiegel , credits given to European governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives . A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that " The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " In previous years , Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank . " These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines . In May 2010 , the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and Great Britain third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP during 2010 .
Baptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and that it must be done by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or sprinkling ) . Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency ( liberty ) , salvation through faith alone , Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice , and the autonomy of the local congregation . Baptists recognize two ministerial offices , pastors and deacons . Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches , though some Baptists disavow this identity .
The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland . The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the west from Alpine , Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County , New Jersey ; the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest ; the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast ; and to the east , Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island . Directly north of the Bronx are ( from west to east ) the adjoining Westchester County communities of Yonkers , Mount Vernon , Pelham Manor and New Rochelle . ( There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough of Manhattan , over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek . Marble Hill 's postal ZIP code , telephonic Area Code and fire service , however , are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan . )
Eliot and her circle , who included her companion George Henry Lewes ( the biographer of Goethe ) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau , were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte , whom Martineau had translated . Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity ( which worshiped the dead , since most humans who have ever lived are dead ) , complete with holidays and liturgy , modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism . Although Comte 's English followers , like Eliot and Martineau , for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system , they liked the idea of a religion of humanity . Comte 's austere vision of the universe , his injunction to " vivre pour altrui " ( " live for others " , from which comes the word " altruism " ) , and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Much of YouTube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . In 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . In May 2013 , Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . In February 2015 , Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
Another scholar contends that the minority leader position emerged even before 1883 . On the Democratic side , " there were serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873 , " indicating that the " nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership . " Further , when Republicans were in the minority , the party nominated for Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers , including ex-Speaker James Blaine of Maine in 1875 , former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio , in 1876 , 1877 , and 1879 , and ex-Speaker Keifer in 1883 . " It is hard to believe that House partisans would place a man in the speakership when in the majority , and nominate him for this office when in the minority , and not look to him for legislative guidance . " This was not the case , according to some observers , with respect to ex-Speaker Keifer .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( crossreacting ) , or by vaccination . Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens . There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .

The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation . Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ : " As a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , O God . " Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened .
During the Permian all the Earth 's major land masses , except portions of East Asia , were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea . Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles , with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ( Panthalassa , the universal sea ) , and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana . The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink . A new ocean was growing on its southern end , the Tethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era . Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ( " continental climate " ) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns . Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
In the 1990s , New York City began closing the large , public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools . Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety . Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include John F. Kennedy , James Monroe , Taft , Theodore Roosevelt , Adlai Stevenson , Evander Childs , Christopher Columbus , Morris , Walton , and South Bronx High Schools . More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools , also replacing them with smaller schools .
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .

Portuguese pavement ( in Portuguese , Calçada Portuguesa ) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal , and common throughout the Lusosphere . Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex , it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design . In Portuguese-speaking countries , many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even , though far more occasionally , streets done in this mosaic form . Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
On the morning of March 28 , 1969 , at the age of 78 , Eisenhower died in Washington , D.C. of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The following day his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral 's Bethlehem Chapel , where he lay in repose for 28 hours . On March 30 , his body was brought by caisson to the United States Capitol , where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda . On March 31 , Eisenhower 's body was returned to the National Cathedral , where he was given an Episcopal Church funeral service .
Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of Romanitas . Rome 's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities , including their traditional gods , the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the diis deabusque omnibus ( all the gods and goddesses ) . They also brought Roman " domestic " deities and cult practices with them . By the same token , the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military .
The city has a unique status in Brazil , as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other cities in Brazil . The name 'Brasília ' is commonly used as a synonym for the Federal District through synecdoche ; However , the Federal District is composed of 31 administrative regions , only one of which is Brasília proper , with a population of 209,926 in a 2011 survey ; Demographic publications generally do not make this distinction and list the population of Brasília as synonymous with the population of the Federal District , considering the whole of it as its metropolitan area . The city was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Additionally , Brasília hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government , such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates ( 2007 ) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video , with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape . Describing the Arab Spring ( 2010- ) , sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist 's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using " Facebook to schedule the protests , Twitter to coordinate , and YouTube to tell the world . " In 2012 , more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the " Kony 2012 " video was posted to YouTube , with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video " will do more to lead to ( Kony 's ) demise than all other action combined . "
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of God . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . They consider the Bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist Andrew Holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body , through Watch Tower Society publications , carry almost as much weight as the Bible . Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended ; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . Adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding . " The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower 's combat command skills ; during the initial phase of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's move into the Kasserine Pass , Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates . He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall , commanding U.S. II Corps . He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns . In February 1943 , his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery . The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign . Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA .
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed . The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium ( often adhesive-backed paper , sticky plastic or soft lime or putty ) as it will appear when installed . When the mosaic is complete , a similar medium is placed atop it . The piece is then turned over , the original underlying material is carefully removed , and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above . In comparison to the indirect method , this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator , to avoid damaging the work . Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work , which is important e.g . when the human figure is involved . This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use ( patent n. 0000222556 ) under the name of his company , Sicis International Srl , now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl .
On the domestic front , he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege . He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President , Richard Nixon . He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security . He also launched the Interstate Highway System , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act , and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act .
Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by Edward Burne-Jones at St Pauls within the Walls in Rome . Another modern mosaic of note is the world 's largest mosaic installation located at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis , located in St. Louis , Missouri . A modern example of mosaic is the Museum of Natural History station of the New York City Subway ( there are many such works of art scattered throughout the New York City subway system , though many IND stations are usually designed with bland mosaics . ) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some Texas interstate highways .
The Earth of the early Archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . During this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .
Since then , tourism in Nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu 's religious sites such as Pashupatinath , Swayambhunath , Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha . From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000 . Following the end of the Maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . Since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic . In economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
The neighbourhood of Thamel is Kathmandu 's primary " traveller 's ghetto " , packed with guest houses , restaurants , shops , and bookstores , catering to tourists . Another neighbourhood of growing popularity is Jhamel , a name for Jhamsikhel coined to rhyme with Thamel . Jhochhen Tol , also known as Freak Street , is Kathmandu 's original traveler 's haunt , made popular by the hippies of the 1960s and 1970s ; it remains a popular alternative to Thamel . Asan is a bazaar and ceremonial square on the old trade route to Tibet , and provides a fine example of a traditional neighbourhood .
In contrast to the Proterozoic , Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments , such as graywackes , mudstones , volcanic sediments and banded iron formations . Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations , consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks . The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs , while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin . In short , greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents .
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology . Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
In recent years a number of well-known tourism-related organizations have placed Greek destinations in the top of their lists . In 2009 Lonely Planet ranked Thessaloniki , the country 's second-largest city , the world 's fifth best " Ultimate Party Town " , alongside cities such as Montreal and Dubai , while in 2011 the island of Santorini was voted as the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure . The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe . Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014 .
By the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state , with a large plebeian , artisan class excluded from the old patrician gentes and from the state priesthoods . The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours ; according to tradition , Rome 's Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine ; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter , Juno and Minerva , installed in a Capitoline temple , built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival , Epulum Jovis . These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned , as if noble guests , at their own inaugural banquet .
Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers . Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards . It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk , sugar and spices . Alcohol is widely drunk , and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages . Drinking and driving is illegal , and authorities have a zero tolerance policy . Ailaa and thwon ( alcohol made from rice ) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu , found in all the local bhattis ( alcohol serving eateries ) . Chhyaang , tongba ( fermented millet or barley ) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu . However , shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers .
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . Among these groups , many Irish Americans , Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here . In addition , French , German , Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . The Jewish population also increased notably during this time . In 1937 , according to Jewish organizations , 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011 . Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
This prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy 's highly criticized methods against communism . To facilitate relations with Congress , Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy 's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the White House . This position drew criticism from a number of corners . In late 1953 McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 Senate elections . Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists . Nevertheless , he refused .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation . Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ : " As a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , O God . " Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened .
In 2009 , Hispanic and Latino Americans represented 52.0 % of the Bronx 's population . Puerto Ricans represented 23.2 % of the borough 's population . Over 72,500 Mexicans lived in the Bronx , and they formed 5.2 % of the population . Cubans numbered over 9,640 members and formed 0.7 % of the population . In addition , over 319,000 people were of various Hispanic and Latino groups , such as Dominican , Salvadoran , and so on . These groups collectively represented 22.9 % of the population . At the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) . Asian Americans are a small but sizable minority in the borough . Roughly 49,600 Asians make up 3.6 % of the population . Roughly 13,600 Indians call the Bronx home , along with 9,800 Chinese , 6,540 Filipinos , 2,260 Vietnamese , 2,010 Koreans , and 1,100 Japanese .
Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life , and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948 . He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game , to the point of golfing during winter ; he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground . He had a small , basic golf facility installed at Camp David , and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts , inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions . Roberts , an investment broker , also handled the Eisenhower family 's investments . Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs , which proved financially lucrative .
Motorcycles are also commonly used , particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach , to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles . Bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public . In addition , their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot .
The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan . It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books . English , Nepali , Sanskrit , Hindi , and Nepal Bhasa books are found here . The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD . Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library , located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building . This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana . It covers a wide range of subjects including history , law , art , religion , and philosophy , as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra , which is believed to be over 1,000 years old . The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building , and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated .
The agglomeration of Kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . The urban area of the Kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . They have the three highest population densities in the country . Within the districts lie VDCs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( Bhaktapur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( Lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( Kathmandu ) . Some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , Gonggabu VDC notably recorded a density over 20,000 people/km2 . ( 2011 census ) . The following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
The official published membership statistics , such as those mentioned above , include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry ; official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings . As a result , only about half of those who self-identified as Jehovah 's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself . The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion : about 37 % of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah 's Witnesses .
Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925 , and continued through the Democrats ' control of the House from 1931 to 1995 , save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55 , all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent . The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965 , Hale Boggs who died in a plane crash , and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats ' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections . Since 1995 , the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner , though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections . He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011 . In 1998 , with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation , both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert .
Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions ( e.g. , influenza ) . Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted . Other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection , such as vector transmission or sexual transmission , are usually not regarded as " contagious " , and often do not require medical isolation ( sometimes loosely called quarantine ) of victims . However , this specialized connotation of the word " contagious " and " contagious disease " ( easy transmissibility ) is not always respected in popular use .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . As a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . Also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . As a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
In brief , there is disagreement among historical analysts as to the exact time period when the minority leadership emerged officially as a party position . Nonetheless , it seems safe to conclude that the position emerged during the latter part of the 19th century , a period of strong party organization and professional politicians . This era was " marked by strong partisan attachments , resilient patronage-based party organizations , and ... high levels of party voting in Congress . " Plainly , these were conditions conducive to the establishment of a more highly differentiated House leadership structure .
Despite popular conceptions promoted by movies and television , many US police departments prefer not to maintain officers in non-patrol bureaus and divisions beyond a certain period of time , such as in the detective bureau , and instead maintain policies that limit service in such divisions to a specified period of time , after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties . [ citation needed ] This is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats , prevent crime by their presence , respond to crimes in progress , manage crises , and practice their skills . [ citation needed ]
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
Since then , the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party 's nominee for President , starting with a vote of 2-1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928 , followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt . ( Both had been Governors of New York , but Republican former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey won only 28 % of the Bronx 's vote in 1948 against 55 % for Pres . Harry Truman , the winning Democrat , and 17 % for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives . It was only 32 years earlier , by contrast , that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency , Charles Evans Hughes , had won 42.6 % of the Bronx 's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson 's 49.8 % and Socialist candidate Allan Benson 's 7.3 % . )
In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 7.2 % it accounted for in 2006 , but still below the EU average of 10 % in 2008 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . In 2013 and for several months , Greece produced more than 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
The Portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum . The city has six international schools : American School of Brasília , Brasília International School ( BIS ) , Escola das Nações , Swiss International School ( SIS ) , Lycée français François-Mitterrand ( LfFM ) and Maple Bear Canadian School . August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - The British School of Brasilia . Brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
In 2010 Piraeus handled 513,319 TEUs , followed by Thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 TEUs . In the same year , 83.9 million people passed through Greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of Paloukia in Salamis , another 12.7 through the port of Perama , 9.5 million through Piraeus and 2.7 million through Igoumenitsa . In 2013 , Piraeus handled a record 3.16 million TEUs , the third-largest figure in the Mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through Pier II , owned by COSCO and 644,000 were transported through Pier I , owned by the Greek state .
On May 1 , 1960 , a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over Soviet Union airspace . The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an East–West summit conference , which had been scheduled in Paris , 15 days later . Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil . Four days after Powers disappeared , the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had " gone missing " north of Turkey . It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged , and falsely claimed that " the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties . "
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
Protestantism spread in Europe during the 16th century . Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] Denmark , [ d ] Norway , [ e ] Sweden , [ f ] Finland , [ g ] Prussia , [ h ] Latvia , [ i ] , Estonia , [ j ] and Iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] Hungary , [ m ] the Netherlands , [ n ] Scotland , [ o ] Switzerland , [ p ] and France [ q ] by such reformers as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . Arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany . In 1534 , King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England [ s ] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of Edward VI , through Thomas Cranmer , Richard Hooker , Matthew Parker and other theologians . There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist , Moravian , and other Pietistic movements . In later centuries , Protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .

Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous animistic practices of Nepal . It is practiced by Kirat people . Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs , such as ancestor worship ( worship of Ajima ) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin . Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats , such as Pashupatinath , Wanga Akash Bhairabh ( Yalambar ) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu . Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice Mundhum in the city .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support some church , but this was more often Dutch Reformed , Quaker or Presbyterian , than Anglican . Some chose to support more than one church . He also ordained that the tax-payers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the Duke , as an openly divine-right Catholic , was no friend of Anglicanism . The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698 , though Anglicanism was more popular in New York .
Over New York City in 1953 , Eastern Airlines Flight 8610 , a commercial flight , had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610 , a Lockheed C-121 Constellation known as Columbine II , while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower . This prompted the adoption of the unique call sign Air Force One , to be used whenever the president is on board any US Air Force aircraft . Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris , where student members are controlled by faculty " masters , " provided a standard for universities , the application of this model took at least three different forms . There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum ; this model tended to train specialists . There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature . There were also universities that combined these models , using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization .
On March 31 , 2010 , the YouTube website launched a new design , with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site . Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented : " We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter . " In May 2010 , it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day , which it described as " nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined " . In May 2011 , YouTube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day . In January 2012 , YouTube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day .
Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries , most notably with Nicolas Delamare 's Traité de la Police ( " Treatise on the Police " ) , first published in 1705 . The German Polizeiwissenschaft ( Science of Police ) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police . Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften ( 1937 ) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however , this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault 's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850 .
By the end of the early modern period , the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context . Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging . The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture , and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state .
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature . Published in 2008 , The World In Grey : Dom Bosco 's Prophecy , by author Ryan J. Lucero , tells an apocalypticle story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco . According to Don Bosco 's prophecy : " Between parallels 15 and 20 , around a lake which shall be formed ; A great civilization will thrive , and that will be the Promised Land . " Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S , where an artificial lake ( Paranoá Lake ) was formed . Don Bosco is Brasília 's patron saint .
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years ( Deflem , 2002 ) . For example , in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals . A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London . The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe , which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War . There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) . It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception . It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( Sheptycki , 2000 ) .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons . First , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified . Second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease . This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR . Third , the essential tools for directing PCR , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway , 12-696 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings , which are allowed , must allow various faiths to lead prayer , or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian . On May 5 , 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings , but also for sectarian prayers like predominately Christian prayers .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
A series of low-lying annexes ( largely hidden ) flank both ends . Also in the square are the glass-faced Planalto Palace housing the presidential offices , and the Palace of the Supreme Court . Farther east , on a triangle of land jutting into the lake , is the Palace of the Dawn ( Palácio da Alvorada ; the presidential residence ) . Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city 's cathedral , considered by many to be Niemeyer 's finest achievement ( see photographs of the interior ) . The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports , which join in a circle 115 feet ( 35 meters ) above the floor of the nave ; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass . The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways . Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace , Itamaraty Palace , the National Theater , and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture . The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings .
The largest ethnic groups are Newar ( 29.6 % ) , Matwali ( 25.1 % Sunuwar , Gurung , Magars , Tamang etc . ) , Khas Brahmins ( 20.51 % ) and Chettris ( 18.5 % ) . Tamangs originating from surrounding hill districts can be seen in Kathmandu . More recently , other hill ethnic groups and Caste groups from Terai have come to represent a substantial proportion of the city 's population . The major languages are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa , while English is understood by many , particularly in the service industry . The major religions are Hinduism and Buddhism .
House minority leaders also hold joint news conferences and consult with their counterparts in the Senate—and with the president if their party controls the White House . The overall objectives are to develop a coordinated communications strategy , to share ideas and information , and to present a united front on issues . Minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the House ; they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country ; and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements . They must also be prepared " to debate on the floor , ad lib , no notes , on a moment 's notice , " remarked Minority Leader Michel . In brief , minority leaders are key strategists in developing and promoting the party 's agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the opposition 's arguments and proposals .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942 . Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . He organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . Knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding Witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code .
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
Historically , the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient Armenia . The earliest attestations of the exonym Armenia date around the 6th century BC . In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC , Darius I the Great of Persia refers to Urashtu ( in Babylonian ) as Armina ( in Old Persian ; Armina ( ) and Harminuya ( in Elamite ) . In Greek , Αρμένιοι " Armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus ( 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians .
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan ( 1906–1955 ) . It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings , letters and papers , memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members . The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to king Mahendra of Nepal ( 1920–1972 ) . Like the Tribhuvan Museum , it includes his personal belongings such as decorations , stamps , coins and personal notes and manuscripts , but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber . The Hanumandhoka Palace , a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar , contains three separate museums of historic importance . These museums include the Birendra museum , which contains items related to the second-last monarch , Birendra of Nepal .
In China , Yellow Emperor is regarded as the humanistic primogenitor . [ citation needed ] Sage kings such as Yao and Shun are humanistic figures as recorded . [ citation needed ] King Wu of Zhou has the famous saying : " Humanity is the Ling ( efficacious essence ) of the world ( among all ) .

J. Brent Walker , Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee , responded to Hamburger 's claims noting ; " The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle . Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture . Of course , separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools . But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry "
In the American Old West , policing was often of very poor quality . [ citation needed ] The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organized posses . [ citation needed ] Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors , notably the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , which was hired by individuals , businessmen , local governments and the federal government . At its height , the Pinkerton Agency 's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army . [ citation needed ]
In the 1960 election to choose his successor , Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President , Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy . He told friends , " I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy . " He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days , although he may have done Nixon some harm . When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , Eisenhower joked , " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " Kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy . Eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as Kennedy was 43 .
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers . According to Gopalraj Vansawali , a genealogy of Nepali monarchs , the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas , Mahispalas , Aabhirs , Kirants , and Somavanshi . The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber . During the Kirata era , a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu . In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages , Kathmandu is still called Yambu . Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu , near Manjupattan . During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler , Jitedasti , Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
Most videos enable users to leave comments , and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content . In 2006 , Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling " community and collaboration on a scale never seen before " , and added that YouTube " harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom . Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone , never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred " . The Guardian in 2009 described users ' comments on YouTube as :
The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party , and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader . Unlike the Majority Leader , the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress . If the Minority Leader 's party takes control of the House , and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats , the Minority Leader is usually the party 's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress , while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader . The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues .
Once the coastal assault had succeeded , Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy , and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany . Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group 's attack being made in the north , while Generals Bradley ( 12th U.S. Army Group ) and Devers ( Sixth U.S. Army Group ) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front ( respectively ) . Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces , often by giving them tactical , though sometimes ineffective , latitude ; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe . However , due to Eisenhower 's persistence , the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully , albeit belatedly , opened in late 1944 , and victory became a more distinct probability .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented . After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium , in a stone chamber " which had on a previous occasion [ 228 BC ] also been polluted by human victims , a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings " . Livy avoids the word " sacrifice " in connection with this bloodless human life-offering ; Plutarch does not . The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC , preparatory to an invasion of Gaul . Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain .
On 31 October 1517 , Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints ' , the Castle Church in Wittenberg . The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy , but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory , particular judgment , and the authority of the pope . He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary , the intercession of and devotion to the saints , the sacraments , mandatory clerical celibacy , monasticism , further on the authority of the pope , the ecclesiastical law , censure and excommunication , the role of secular rulers in religious matters , the relationship between Christianity and the law , good works , and the sacraments .
Energy production in Greece is dominated by the Public Power Corporation ( known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ , or in English DEI ) . In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6 % of all energy demand in Greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . Almost half ( 48 % ) of DEI 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009 . Another 12 % comes from Hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . Between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010 .
After the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite in 1957 , Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA , which led to the space race . During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Eisenhower condemned the Israeli , British and French invasion of Egypt , and forced them to withdraw . He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action . In 1958 , Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution . Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident . In his January 17 , 1961 farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending , particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers , and coined the term " military–industrial complex " .
After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa , Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily . Once Mussolini , the Italian leader , had fallen in Italy , the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche . But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians , the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country – making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of Italy was highly successful .
In January 1917 , the Watch Tower Society 's legal representative , Joseph Franklin Rutherford , was elected as its next president . His election was disputed , and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
Greece was accused of trying to cover up the extent of its massive budget deficit in the wake of the global financial crisis . The allegation was prompted by the massive revision of the 2009 budget deficit forecast by the new PASOK government elected in October 2009 , from " 6–8 % " ( estimated by the previous New Democracy government ) to 12.7 % ( later revised to 15.7 % ) . However , the accuracy of the revised figures has also been questioned , and in February 2012 the Hellenic Parliament voted in favor of an official investigation following accusations by a former member of the Hellenic Statistical Authority that the deficit had been artificially inflated in order to justify harsher austerity measures .
Legendary Princess Bhrikuti ( 7th-century ) and artist Araniko ( 1245 - 1306 AD ) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China . There are over 108 traditional monasteries ( Bahals and Bahis ) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism . Since the 1960s , the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area . Also , with the modernization of Newar Buddhism , various Theravada Bihars have been established .
Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings , a far more prestigious artform , and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos . Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek , suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire ; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves . Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa , in places such as Carthage , and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis , Tunisia .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
Beginning in first decade of the 15th century , Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest , Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe 's writings , founded the Hussite movement . He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination . He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance , Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . After his execution , a revolt erupted . Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope .
Maharaja Ranjit Singh 's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state . Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down , starting the First Anglo-Sikh War ; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to British India . After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 , the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India . In Jhelum 35 British soldiers of HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . [ citation needed ]
According to Eurostat , Greece 's largest port by tons of goods transported in 2010 is the port of Aghioi Theodoroi , with 17.38 million tons . The Port of Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons , followed by the Port of Piraeus , with 13.2 million tons , and the port of Eleusis , with 12.37 million tons . The total number of goods transported through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million tons , a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the country in 2007 . Since then , Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean 's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO . In 2013 , Piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world .
The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet , stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible , and that it has not claimed its predictions were " the words of Jehovah . " George D. Chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 , 1925 and 1975 , the changing views and dates of the Jehovah 's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions . Chryssides further states , " it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the Witnesses as a group that continues to set a single end-date that fails and then devise a new one , as many counter-cultists do . " However , sociologist Andrew Holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago , " Witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time . "
The onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . June and July are oppressively hot . Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °C , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °C . In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . The hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late October .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement . Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots , it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles . From there it spread around the world , carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there . These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history , such as seen in the two Great Awakenings . Pentecostalism , which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations , continues to be an important force in Western Christianity .
In 2010 Piraeus handled 513,319 TEUs , followed by Thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 TEUs . In the same year , 83.9 million people passed through Greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of Paloukia in Salamis , another 12.7 through the port of Perama , 9.5 million through Piraeus and 2.7 million through Igoumenitsa . In 2013 , Piraeus handled a record 3.16 million TEUs , the third-largest figure in the Mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through Pier II , owned by COSCO and 644,000 were transported through Pier I , owned by the Greek state .
The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute , in the form of the Heinrich Heine Memorial , better known as the Lorelei Fountain from one of Heine 's best-known works ( 1838 ) . After Heine 's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected , allegedly for anti-Semitic motives , a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet ( 1797–1856 ) , his incensed German-American admirers , including Carl Schurz , started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan , at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street . However , this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism , aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art .
On 31 October 1517 , Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints ' , the Castle Church in Wittenberg . The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy , but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory , particular judgment , and the authority of the pope . He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary , the intercession of and devotion to the saints , the sacraments , mandatory clerical celibacy , monasticism , further on the authority of the pope , the ecclesiastical law , censure and excommunication , the role of secular rulers in religious matters , the relationship between Christianity and the law , good works , and the sacraments .
As the 1954 congressional elections approached , and it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses , Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses , and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP . Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate , progressive Republican : " I have just one purpose ... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country . If the right wing wants a fight , they are going to get it ... before I end up , either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I wo n't be with them anymore . "
The enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu . " Narayanhity " comes from Narayana , a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu , and Hiti , meaning " water spout " ( Vishnu 's temple is located opposite the palace , and the water spout is located east of the main entrance to the precinct ) . Narayanhity was a new palace , in front of the old palace built in 1915 , and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary Pagoda . It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah , then heir apparent to the throne . The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads . The palace area covers ( 30 hectares ( 74 acres ) ) and is fully secured with gates on all sides . This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre . After the fall of the monarchy , it was converted to a museum .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
From an institutional perspective , the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader . For example , Rule XII , clause 6 , grant the minority leader ( or his designee ) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions ; Rule II , clause 6 , states the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker , majority leader , and minority leader ; and Rule XV , clause 6 , provides that the Speaker , after consultation with the minority leader , may place legislation on the Corrections Calendar . The minority leader also has other institutional duties , such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities .
Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials . They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas , once common in the Eastern Mediterranean . The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham 's Palace , Palestine which was made around 744 . The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer ( right side ) and two deers peacefully grazing ( left side ) . The panel probably represents good and bad governance . Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar , Lebanon . The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat ( in present-day Jordan ) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill . The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by " good " animals on one side and " bad " animals on the other . Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls , grapes , pomegranates , oryx , wolves , hares , a leopard , pairs of partridges , fish , bulls , ostriches , rabbits , rams , goats , lions and a snake . At Qastal , near Amman , excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan , dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ( 685–705 ) . They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor . The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns , trees , animals , fruits and rosettes . Except for the open courtyard , entrance and staircases , the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics .
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
Edgar took the first turn at school , and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery . Edgar asked for a second year , Dwight consented and worked for a second year . At that time , a friend " Swede " Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school , since no tuition was required . Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S . Senator , Joseph L. Bristow . Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition , he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy . He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911 .
The ecumenical movement has had an influence on mainline churches , beginning at least in 1910 with the Edinburgh Missionary Conference . Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa , Asia and Oceania . Since 1948 , the World Council of Churches has been influential , but ineffective in creating a united church . There are also ecumenical bodies at regional , national and local levels across the globe ; but schisms still far outnumber unifications . One , but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement , has been the move to form united churches , such as the Church of South India , the Church of North India , the US-based United Church of Christ , the United Church of Canada , the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships . There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement , though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine .
The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support some church , but this was more often Dutch Reformed , Quaker or Presbyterian , than Anglican . Some chose to support more than one church . He also ordained that the tax-payers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the Duke , as an openly divine-right Catholic , was no friend of Anglicanism . The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698 , though Anglicanism was more popular in New York .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
In addition , the minority leader has a number of other institutional functions . For instance , the minority leader is sometimes statutorily authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities ; he or she and the majority leader each name three Members to serve as Private Calendar objectors ; he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening the House per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent adjournment resolutions ; he or she is a traditional member of the House Office Building Commission ; he or she is a member of the United States Capitol Preservation Commission ; and he or she may , after consultation with the Speaker , convene an early organizational party caucus or conference . Informally , the minority leader maintains ties with majority party leaders to learn about the schedule and other House matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as feasible .
The Bronx Museum of the Arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx . Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from Africa , Asia and Latin America , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica .
The capital and largest city is Lahore which was the historical capital of the wider Punjab region . Other important cities include Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Gujranwala , Sargodha , Multan , Sialkot , Bahawalpur , Gujrat , Sheikhupura , Jhelum and Sahiwal . Undivided Punjab is home to six rivers , of which five flow through Pakistani Punjab . From west to east , these are : the Indus , Jhelum , Beas , Chenab , Ravi and Sutlej . Nearly 60 % of Pakistan 's population lives in the Punjab . It is the nation 's only province that touches every other province ; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad . In the acronym P-A-K-I-S-T-A-N , the P is for Punjab .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement . Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles , gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way ( via media ) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions . The English Reformation followed a particular course . The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII . King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome . In 1534 , the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . Between 1535 and 1540 , under Thomas Cromwell , the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect . Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I , a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I . The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition . The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other . It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century .
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide , [ ad ] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians . [ ae ] In 2010 , a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa , 260 million in the Americas , 140 million in Asia-Pacific region , 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa . Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population . Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world 's Christians at 33 % , 36 % , 36.7 % , and 40 % , while in relation to the world 's population at 11.6 % and 13 % .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world , Armenians ( especially in the diaspora ) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations . These include the Armenian Catholic Church ( which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the Roman Catholic Pope ) , the Armenian Evangelical Church , which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away , and the Armenian Brotherhood Church , which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church , but later broke apart from it . There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover .
Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília . The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras ( " superblocks " ) : groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools , retail stores , and open spaces . At the northern end of Lake Paranoá , separated from the inner city , is a peninsula with many fashionable homes , and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore . Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake , but during early development private clubs , hotels , and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water . Set well apart from the city are satellite cities , including Gama , Ceilândia , Taguatinga , Núcleo Bandeirante , Sobradinho , and Planaltina . These cities , with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned .
The style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the White House , the general political climate in the House , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . Despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . Many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book . Others have devolved upon the position in other ways . To be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him or her as a Representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map , made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba , Jordan . It was rediscovered in 1894 . The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land . It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south , and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert . The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem , at the center of the map . The map is enriched with many naturalistic features , like animals , fishing boats , bridges and palm trees
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
Small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside of Armenia for centuries . For example , a community has existed for over a millennium in the Holy Land , and one of the four quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem has been called the Armenian Quarter . An Armenian Catholic monastic community of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near Venice , Italy . There are also remnants of formerly populous communities in India , Myanmar , Thailand , Belgium , Portugal , Italy , Poland , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria , Romania , Serbia , Ethiopia , Sudan and Egypt .

Haruspicy was also used in public cult , under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate . The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice , particularly the liver . They also interpreted omens , prodigies and portents , and formulated their expiation . Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient , ethnically Etruscan " outsider " religious profession , separate from Rome 's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy , essential but never quite respectable . During the mid-to-late Republic , the reformist Gaius Gracchus , the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla , and the " notorious Verres " justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners . The senate and armies used the public haruspices : at some time during the late Republic , the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination . Being of independent means , they would be better motivated to maintain a pure , religious practice for the public good . The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect : none of this seems to have troubled Marius , who employed a Syrian prophetess .
The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals . Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire : in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors . Ambrose , the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus 's request for tolerance . Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of Rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] He was the last emperor of both East and West .
On the other hand , in his study on nine of " the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world " , Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn , Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University , wrote : “The NW [ New World Translation ] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators , BeDuhn stated : “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal , conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament " violate [ s ] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God " .
Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide , typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire . Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict . ( See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide )
Multiracial Americans are also a sizable minority in the Bronx . People of multiracial heritage number over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and African American heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1 % of the population . People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1 % of the population .
In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede , Santa Maria in Domnica , Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura , Santa Cecilia in Trastevere , Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano . The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics . They were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . Another great work of Pope Leo , the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna , depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side , and SS . Susanna and Felicity on the other . It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . Pope Paschal I ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
To a large extent , the minority leader 's position is a 20th-century innovation . Prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized , so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader . Decades went by before anything like the modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders . However , from the beginning days of Congress , various House members intermittently assumed the role of " opposition leader . " Some scholars suggest that Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned as the first " minority leader " because in the First Congress he led the opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton 's fiscal policies .
Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of Internet use , with the gap closing rapidly in recent years . The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , from 23 % to 56 % respectively ( compared with an EU average of 49 % and 79 % ) . At the same time , there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection , from 4 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2013 ( compared with an EU average of 30 % and 76 % ) . However , Greece also has the EU 's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet : 36 % in 2013 , down from 65 % in 2006 ( compared with an EU average of 21 % and 42 % ) .
Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
In the Regal era , a rex sacrorum ( king of the sacred rites ) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king ( rex ) or in his absence , and announced the public festivals . He had little or no civil authority . With the abolition of monarchy , the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased . By the late Republican era , the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia . The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title : his religious duties still included the daily , ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus .
Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty-five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand-year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid-1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of God . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . They consider the Bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist Andrew Holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body , through Watch Tower Society publications , carry almost as much weight as the Bible . Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended ; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . Adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding . " The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century , and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement ( 1140 ) . The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary , St John and the two patron saints , Cipriano and Cipriana . When the church was demolished in the 19th century , the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia . It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
At the 2009 American Community Survey , Black Americans made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos . Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third ( 35.4 % ) of the Bronx 's population . Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8 % of the population . Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough , of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks . Over 61,000 people identified themselves as " Sub-Saharan African " in the survey , making up 4.4 % of the population .
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
Baptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and that it must be done by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or sprinkling ) . Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency ( liberty ) , salvation through faith alone , Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice , and the autonomy of the local congregation . Baptists recognize two ministerial offices , pastors and deacons . Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches , though some Baptists disavow this identity .
Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life , and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948 . He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game , to the point of golfing during winter ; he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground . He had a small , basic golf facility installed at Camp David , and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts , inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions . Roberts , an investment broker , also handled the Eisenhower family 's investments . Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs , which proved financially lucrative .
Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal , displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists . Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts . Art in Kathmandu is vibrant , demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art , derived from a great number of national , Asian , and global influences . Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas : the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet , closely linked to the country 's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting , including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for . Internationally , the British-based charity , the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . As a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . Also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . As a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
Soteriologically , most Methodists are Arminian , emphasizing that Christ accomplished salvation for every human being , and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it ( as opposed to the traditional Calvinist doctrine of monergism ) . Methodism is traditionally low church in liturgy , although this varies greatly between individual congregations ; the Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition ; John Wesley 's brother , Charles , was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church , and many other eminent hymn writers come from the Methodist tradition .
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith ( see Christian Humanism ) . They inveighed against the abuses of the Church , but not against the Church itself , much less against religion . For them , the word " secular " carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later , in the nineteenth century . In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery . Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo 's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own ( although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life ) . He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue , inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer . By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base , however , the methods of the humanists , combined with their eloquence , would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority .
The name Anabaptist , meaning " one who baptizes again " , was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants . Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants . The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist , claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void , the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism . As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues , Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics . [ aa ] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount , which precluded taking oaths , participating in military actions , and participating in civil government , some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise . [ ab ] They were thus technically Anabaptists , even though conservative Amish , Mennonites , and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism . Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front . Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden , Thomas Müntzer , Kaspar Schwenkfeld , Sebastian Franck , Menno Simons . Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck , Conrad Grebel , Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz .
The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of New York City in the state of New York , located south of Westchester County . Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River , as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens . Of the five boroughs , the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate , Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea 's Hellenised elite . Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them . Early Italian synagogues have left few traces ; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period . Judaea 's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora ; in Rome , this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion . Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by Julius Caesar . By the Augustan era , the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews . In some periods under Roman rule , Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice , under certain conditions . Judaism was a superstitio to Cicero , but the Church Father Tertullian described it as religio licita ( an officially permitted religion ) in contrast to Christianity .
The great Navicella mosaic ( 1305–1313 ) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter 's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone . The giant mosaic , commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi , was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard . It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters . This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter 's in the 17th century . Navicella means " little ship " referring to the large boat which dominated the scene , and whose sail , filled by the storm , loomed over the horizon . Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art .
This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "
In a video posted on July 21 , 2009 , YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos . The videos can be viewed in several different ways , including the common anaglyph ( cyan/red lens ) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect . The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows , columns or a checkerboard pattern , side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan , green/magenta or blue/yellow combination . In May 2011 , an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision .
From the early 16th century , both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule . Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia , significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires . From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya , and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century , Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid , Afsharid and Qajar empires , while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule . In the late 1820s , the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan ( all of Eastern Armenia ) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran 's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War ( 1826-1828 ) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay . Western Armenia however , remained in Ottoman hands .
Prior to his inauguration , Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the Korean War to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy . His inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
Educational attainment : In 2000 , according to the U.S. Census , out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old , 62.3 % had graduated from high school and 14.6 % held a bachelor 's or higher college degree . These percentages were lower than those for New York 's other boroughs , which ranged from 68.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 82.6 % ( Staten Island ) for high school graduates over 24 , and from 21.8 % ( Brooklyn ) to 49.4 % ( Manhattan ) for college graduates . ( The respective state and national percentages were [ NY ] 79.1 % & 27.4 % and [ US ] 80.4 % & 24.4 % . )
After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna . The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century . Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo . The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest . The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549 . The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco , executed in 545–547 ( largely destroyed ; the remains in Berlin ) .
Official cults were state funded as a " matter of public interest " ( res publica ) . Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . The difference between public and private cult is often unclear . Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . Some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole . All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and pontifices .
In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns ; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae , and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës , Albania in 1916 , is an early figural example ; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC . Mythological subjects , or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy , were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design , with strongly emphasized borders . Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name , describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl . Both of these themes were widely copied .
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
In 1963 , the Robbins Report on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "

J. Brent Walker , Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee , responded to Hamburger 's claims noting ; " The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle . Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture . Of course , separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools . But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry "
In 2014 YouTube said that 300 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute , three times more than one year earlier and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the U.S . The site has 800 million unique users a month . It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 . According to third-party web analytics providers , Alexa and SimilarWeb , YouTube is the third most visited website in the world , as of June 2015 ; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally , attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month .
Over New York City in 1953 , Eastern Airlines Flight 8610 , a commercial flight , had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610 , a Lockheed C-121 Constellation known as Columbine II , while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower . This prompted the adoption of the unique call sign Air Force One , to be used whenever the president is on board any US Air Force aircraft . Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display .
The Abbot of Monte Cassino , Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church . According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse , the arch and the vestibule of the basilica . Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds ( now in the Monte Cassino Museum ) . " The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts " – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy .
In May 2014 , prior to the launch of YouTube 's subscription-based Music Key service , the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were " undervalued " in comparison to other streaming services , and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014 , Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " Stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . However , YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal .
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe , although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals . The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár ( Alba Regia ) had a mosaic decoration in the apse . It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen , executed in the first decades of the 11th century . The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century . The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal . It was executed by Venetian craftsmen .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons . First , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified . Second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease . This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR . Third , the essential tools for directing PCR , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
The centrality of the " separation " concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that " The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . "
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co-ordinate their work , share information , and get help quickly . In recent years , vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatching of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and updating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real-time basis . Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches , whistles , police notebooks and " ticket books " or citations .
In 2009 , Hispanic and Latino Americans represented 52.0 % of the Bronx 's population . Puerto Ricans represented 23.2 % of the borough 's population . Over 72,500 Mexicans lived in the Bronx , and they formed 5.2 % of the population . Cubans numbered over 9,640 members and formed 0.7 % of the population . In addition , over 319,000 people were of various Hispanic and Latino groups , such as Dominican , Salvadoran , and so on . These groups collectively represented 22.9 % of the population . At the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) . Asian Americans are a small but sizable minority in the borough . Roughly 49,600 Asians make up 3.6 % of the population . Roughly 13,600 Indians call the Bronx home , along with 9,800 Chinese , 6,540 Filipinos , 2,260 Vietnamese , 2,010 Koreans , and 1,100 Japanese .
Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term , but as with other decisions , he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again . During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 , he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP 's potential candidates ; the group , in addition to his doctor , concluded a second term was well advised , and he announced in February 1956 he would run again . Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon 's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket ; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition . He personally favored Robert B. Anderson , a Democrat , who rejected his offer ; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party . In 1956 , Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide , with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6 % of the popular vote . The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations .
In 1957 , the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision . Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order . When Faubus balked , the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division . They escorted and protected nine black students ' entry to Little Rock Central High School , an all-white public school , for the first time since the Reconstruction Era . Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions , writing " The overwhelming majority of southerners , Negro and white , stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock " .
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible , education on all levels got a strong boost . By the middle of the eighteenth century , the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent , in Scotland 65 per cent , and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write . Colleges and universities were founded . For example , the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later . About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century , including Yale ( 1701 ) . Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning .
The ecumenical movement has had an influence on mainline churches , beginning at least in 1910 with the Edinburgh Missionary Conference . Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa , Asia and Oceania . Since 1948 , the World Council of Churches has been influential , but ineffective in creating a united church . There are also ecumenical bodies at regional , national and local levels across the globe ; but schisms still far outnumber unifications . One , but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement , has been the move to form united churches , such as the Church of South India , the Church of North India , the US-based United Church of Christ , the United Church of Canada , the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships . There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement , though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church’s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
The last three years of Eisenhower 's second term in office were ones of relatively good health . Eventually after leaving the White House , he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks . A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs . In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis , for which he underwent surgery on December 12 , 1966 , when his gallbladder was removed , containing 16 gallstones . After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 ( see below ) , an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma , a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease . Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip , who is the chief vote counter for his or her party . The current chief deputy majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry . Within the House Republican Conference , the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House Leadership . The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy whips , led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip , which is the highest appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus . The current senior chief deputy minority whip , John Lewis , has held his post since 1991 .
Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured . All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host . An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin . Neither of these colonizations are considered infections . The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance . Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions , and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection . Some colonizing bacteria , such as Corynebacteria sp . and viridans streptococci , prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host , preventing infection and speeding wound healing .
Edgar took the first turn at school , and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery . Edgar asked for a second year , Dwight consented and worked for a second year . At that time , a friend " Swede " Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school , since no tuition was required . Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S . Senator , Joseph L. Bristow . Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition , he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy . He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911 .
Confer With the White House . If his or her party controls the White House , the minority leader confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress , the Administration 's agenda , and political events generally . Strategically , the role of the minority leader will vary depending on whether the President is of the same party or the other party . In general , minority leaders will often work to advance the goals and aspirations of their party 's President in Congress . When Robert Michel , R-IL , was minority leader ( 1981–1995 ) , he typically functioned as the " point man " for Republican presidents . President Ronald Reagan 's 1981 policy successes in the Democratic controlled House was due in no small measure to Minority Leader Michel 's effectiveness in wooing so-called " Reagan Democrats " to support , for instance , the Administration 's landmark budget reconciliation bill . There are occasions , of course , when minority leaders will fault the legislative initiatives of their President . On an administration proposal that could adversely affect his district , Michel stated that he might " abdicate my leadership role [ on this issue ] since I ca n't harmonize my own views with the administration 's . " Minority Leader Gephardt , as another example , has publicly opposed a number of President Clinton 's legislative initiatives from " fast track " trade authority to various budget issues .
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
The Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century . One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist . Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation , which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body , blood , soul , and divinity of Christ . They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion .
In the immediate years after Eisenhower left office , his reputation declined . He was widely seen by critics as an inactive , uninspiring , golf-playing president compared to his vigorous young successor . Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock , Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted . Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment , for the Soviet Union 's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race , and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism .
Episcopalians and Presbyterians , as well as other WASPs , tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated ( having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita ) than most other religious groups in United States , and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business , law and politics , especially the Republican Party . Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors , Rockefeller , Du Pont , Roosevelt , Forbes , Whitneys , the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command , on December 20 , 1944 , he was promoted to General of the Army , equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies . In this and the previous high commands he held , Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy . Although he had never seen action himself , he won the respect of front-line commanders . He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill , Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle . He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy , but these rarely upset his relationships with them . He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov , his Russian counterpart , and they became good friends .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods : a boom period during 1900–29 , with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930 . The Great Depression and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline . The mid to late century were hard times , as the Bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty . The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today .
In the early stages of the First Punic War ( 264 BC ) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat . The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . Even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
As of June 2012 [ update ] , Pakistan 's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab . According to protesters , load shedding was depriving the cities of electricity 20–22 hours a day , causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard . Gujranwala , Toba Tek Singh , Faisalabad , Sialkot , Bahawalnagar and communities across Khanewal District saw widespread rioting and violence on Sunday 17 June 2012 , with the houses of several members of parliament being attacked as well as the offices of regional energy suppliers Fesco , Gepco and Mepco being ransacked or attacked .
In America , Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement 's seminal influence . In the United Kingdom , Colin Urquhart , Michael Harper , David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments . The Massey conference in New Zealand , 1964 was attended by several Anglicans , including the Rev . Ray Muller , who went on to invite Bennett to New Zealand in 1966 , and played a leading role in developing and promoting the Life in the Spirit seminars . Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky .
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
In 1962 , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of officially-sponsored prayer or religious recitations in public schools . In Engel v. Vitale , 370 U.S. 421 ( 1962 ) , the Court , by a vote of 6-1 , determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools , even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation . ( The prayer required by the New York State Board of Regents prior to the Court 's decision consisted of : " Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee , and we beg Thy blessings upon us , our parents , our teachers , and our country . Amen . " ) As the Court stated :
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice ( mainly from the 17th–19th centuries , but the oldest one from 1270–75 , " The burial of St Mark in the first basilica " ) , the Cathedral of Orvieto ( golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century , many times redone ) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca ( huge , striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below , designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century ) . The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the Blessing Christ ( signed by one Solsternus from 1207 ) .
Mosaic has a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine . Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance , though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique . Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics .

From the 9th to 11th century , Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of Lake Van , this included both traditional styles and new innovations . Ornately carved Armenian Khachkars were developed during this time . Many new cities and churches were built during this time , including a new capital at Lake Van and a new Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match . The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty . It was during this time that the first major monasteries , such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were built . This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market , in the West Bronx , is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space , built on a 17 acres ( 7 ha ) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market , a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention , south of Yankee Stadium . The $ 500 million shopping center , which was completed in 2009 , saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings , one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market . The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars . The center has earned itself a LEED " Silver " designation in its design .
The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation . Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ : " As a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , O God . " Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened .
In January 1917 , the Watch Tower Society 's legal representative , Joseph Franklin Rutherford , was elected as its next president . His election was disputed , and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .
Robert N. Bellah has in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States . He used the term " Civil Religion " to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States . His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy : " Considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word 'God ' at all ? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . "
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .

On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]

Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science . In fact , more than 80 % of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained , of which approximately 45 % held university posts . It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable , and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development . There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system , which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world . However , university professors still utilized some autonomy , at least in the sciences , to choose epistemological foundations and methods . For instance , Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction . Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen system , with two distinct seasons : the rainy season , from October to April , and a dry season , from May to September . The average temperature is 20.6 °C ( 69.1 °F ) . September , at the end of the dry season , has the highest average maximum temperature , 28.3 °C ( 82.9 °F ) , has major and minor lower maximum average temperature , of 25.1 °C ( 77.2 °F ) and 12.9 °C ( 55.2 °F ) , respectively . Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C ( 72 °F ) . With 247.4 mm ( 9.7 in ) , January is the month with the highest rainfall of the year , while June is the lowest , with only 8.7 mm ( 0.3 in ) .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond . Terence , an African and a former slave , was well placed to preach the message of universalism , of the essential unity of the human race , that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks , but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality . The influence of Terence 's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated . Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call :
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 . Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan 's nuclear program such as Kahuta . It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi . The peace process between India and Pakistan , which began in earnest in 2004 , has helped pacify the situation . Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common . Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( crossreacting ) , or by vaccination . Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens . There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .
Greece was accused of trying to cover up the extent of its massive budget deficit in the wake of the global financial crisis . The allegation was prompted by the massive revision of the 2009 budget deficit forecast by the new PASOK government elected in October 2009 , from " 6–8 % " ( estimated by the previous New Democracy government ) to 12.7 % ( later revised to 15.7 % ) . However , the accuracy of the revised figures has also been questioned , and in February 2012 the Hellenic Parliament voted in favor of an official investigation following accusations by a former member of the Hellenic Statistical Authority that the deficit had been artificially inflated in order to justify harsher austerity measures .
His primary duty was planning for the next war , which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression . He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur , Army Chief of Staff . In 1932 , he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington , D.C . Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it , he later wrote the Army 's official incident report , endorsing MacArthur 's conduct .
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods : a boom period during 1900–29 , with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930 . The Great Depression and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline . The mid to late century were hard times , as the Bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty . The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today .
In 2014 YouTube said that 300 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute , three times more than one year earlier and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the U.S . The site has 800 million unique users a month . It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 . According to third-party web analytics providers , Alexa and SimilarWeb , YouTube is the third most visited website in the world , as of June 2015 ; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally , attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month .
Juscelino Kubitschek , President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961 , ordered the construction of Brasília , fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise . Building Brasília was part of Juscelino 's " fifty years of prosperity in five " plan . Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 , with 5550 people competing . Oscar Niemeyer , a close friend , was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer . Brasília was built in 41 months , from 1956 to April 21 , 1960 , when it was officially inaugurated .
Organizations including Viacom , Mediaset , and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube , claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material . Viacom , demanding $ 1 billion in damages , said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " . YouTube responded by stating that it " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
At the time , there were many varying opinions about Christian doctrine , and no centralized way of enforcing orthodoxy . Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting , and some 318 bishops ( very few from the Western Empire ) attended the First Council of Nicaea . The purpose of this meeting was to define Christian orthodoxy and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies . The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed and other statements . Later , Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine . Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960 . A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858 . Each of the designs incorporates the text " with appreciation " or " with personal and official gratitude " accompanied with Eisenhower 's initials " D.D.E . " or facsimile signature . The design also incorporates location , date , and/or significant event . Prior to the end of his second term as President , 1,451 medals were turned-in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed . The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series .
Police development-aid to weak , failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention . This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead , especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict ( Goldsmith and Sheptycki , 2007 ) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions ( Hills , 2009 ) .
In the 1960 election to choose his successor , Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President , Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy . He told friends , " I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy . " He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days , although he may have done Nixon some harm . When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , Eisenhower joked , " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " Kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy . Eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as Kennedy was 43 .
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed . The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium ( often adhesive-backed paper , sticky plastic or soft lime or putty ) as it will appear when installed . When the mosaic is complete , a similar medium is placed atop it . The piece is then turned over , the original underlying material is carefully removed , and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above . In comparison to the indirect method , this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator , to avoid damaging the work . Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work , which is important e.g . when the human figure is involved . This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use ( patent n. 0000222556 ) under the name of his company , Sicis International Srl , now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
From 1879 , Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically . Thirty congregations were founded , and during 1879 and 1880 , Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings . As congregations continued to form during Russell 's ministry , they each remained self-administrative , functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance . In 1881 , Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley , and in 1884 , Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles . By about 1900 , Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs , and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices . By the 1910s , Russell 's organization maintained nearly a hundred " pilgrims , " or traveling preachers . Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry , and by 1912 , he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States .
Although Egypt was a majority Christian country before the 7th Century , after Islam arrived , the country was slowly Islamified to become a majority Muslim country . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order .
Until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the German university model had spread around the world . Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . In Britain , the move from Industrial Revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray ( chairman of the University Grants Committee ) and Sir Samuel Curran , with the formation of the University of Strathclyde . The British also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in Europe .
In the wake of the Republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . Augustus , the first Roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . So-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire . Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . This was the context for Rome 's conflict with Christianity , which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings , according to the principle do ut des ( " I give , that you might give " ) . Proper , respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity . Religious neglect was a form of atheism : impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia ( impious errors ) . Excessive devotion , fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio . Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger ( ira deorum ) and therefore harm the State . The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions , and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors . Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values .
The apse mosaic of the Gelati Monastery is a rare example of mosaic use in Georgia . Began by king David IV and completed by his son Demetrius I of Georgia , the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels . The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids . The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople . Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other , lesser known sites . The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes . In Tsromi the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme . Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text .
The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639 . The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various European countries ( particularly Ireland , Germany and Italy ) and later from the Caribbean region ( particularly Puerto Rico , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic ) , as well as African American migrants from the American South . This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
Protestantism spread in Europe during the 16th century . Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] Denmark , [ d ] Norway , [ e ] Sweden , [ f ] Finland , [ g ] Prussia , [ h ] Latvia , [ i ] , Estonia , [ j ] and Iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] Hungary , [ m ] the Netherlands , [ n ] Scotland , [ o ] Switzerland , [ p ] and France [ q ] by such reformers as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . Arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany . In 1534 , King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England [ s ] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of Edward VI , through Thomas Cranmer , Richard Hooker , Matthew Parker and other theologians . There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist , Moravian , and other Pietistic movements . In later centuries , Protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
The small woolen dolls called Maniae , hung on the Compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania , as Mother of the Lares . The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus , traditionally Rome 's Republican founder and first consul . Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example .
The Armenians collective has , at times , constituted a Christian " island " in a mostly Muslim region . There is , however , a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims , known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race , while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years . The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States . Later on , the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin , the original seat of the Catholicosate . In 1441 , a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi , while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia . Therefore , since 1441 , there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges , and with their respective jurisdictions . The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia .
Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide , Protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the Anglican Communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former Prussian Union of churches ) . Nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity .
Like other neighborhoods in New York City , the South Bronx has no official boundaries . The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham Road was often used as a northern limit . The Bronx River more consistently forms an eastern boundary . The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi-unit homes . The South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse , Borough Hall , and other government buildings , as well as Yankee Stadium . The Cross Bronx Expressway bisects it , east to west . The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
Most videos enable users to leave comments , and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content . In 2006 , Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling " community and collaboration on a scale never seen before " , and added that YouTube " harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom . Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone , never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred " . The Guardian in 2009 described users ' comments on YouTube as :
Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials . They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas , once common in the Eastern Mediterranean . The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham 's Palace , Palestine which was made around 744 . The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer ( right side ) and two deers peacefully grazing ( left side ) . The panel probably represents good and bad governance . Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar , Lebanon . The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat ( in present-day Jordan ) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill . The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by " good " animals on one side and " bad " animals on the other . Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls , grapes , pomegranates , oryx , wolves , hares , a leopard , pairs of partridges , fish , bulls , ostriches , rabbits , rams , goats , lions and a snake . At Qastal , near Amman , excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan , dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ( 685–705 ) . They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor . The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns , trees , animals , fruits and rosettes . Except for the open courtyard , entrance and staircases , the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
According to the 2009 American Community Survey , White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth ( 22.9 % ) of the Bronx 's population . However , non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth ( 12.1 % ) of the population , down from 34.4 % in 1980 . Out of all five boroughs , the Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents . 320,640 whites called the Bronx home , of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites . The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent . People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9 % of the population . People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1 % of the population . German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4 % and 0.8 % of the population respectively .
In the following century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art ( see details in Ravenna section ) . Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century . In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo , mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah ; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors , naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion . The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio , which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century , although it was restored many times later . The baptistery of the basilica , which was demolished in the 15th century , had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae , large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated . In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro , now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio , every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century . Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome , while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background . The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists .
He assumed duties again at Camp Meade , Maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . His schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton , Sereno E. Brett , and other senior tank leaders . Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
In the United States , their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties . Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference , the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service , the right of patients to refuse medical treatment , and the right to engage in public discourse . Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada .
As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid-1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9.7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5 % per year .
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( Amendment XIV ) is one of the post-Civil War amendments , intended to secure rights for former slaves . It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others . The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states . While it has not been fully implemented , the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure , through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause , the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available . The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable . The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) . These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins . A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-four , and Alan Rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over Witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation " , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control .
East of the Bronx River , the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas , or 'necks , ' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh : Hunts Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck ( Castle Hill Point ) and Throgs Neck . The East Bronx has older tenement buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multifamily homes , as well as single family homes . It includes New York City 's largest park : Pelham Bay Park along the Westchester-Bronx border .
Davies identifies Paine 's The Age of Reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical , historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach . " The first is political , largely French in inspiration , and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty ' . The second is philosophical , German , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . Homo homini deus est ( " The human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , Feuerbach had written .
In recent years a number of well-known tourism-related organizations have placed Greek destinations in the top of their lists . In 2009 Lonely Planet ranked Thessaloniki , the country 's second-largest city , the world 's fifth best " Ultimate Party Town " , alongside cities such as Montreal and Dubai , while in 2011 the island of Santorini was voted as the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure . The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe . Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014 .
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
Jefferson and James Madison 's conceptions of separation have long been debated . Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency , though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia . Madison issued four religious proclamations while President , but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment . On the other hand , both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol . Years before the ratification of the Constitution , Madison contended " Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large , still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body . " After retiring from the presidency , Madison wrote of " total separation of the church from the state . " " " Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States , " Madison wrote , and he declared , " practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . " In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded , " We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts . do better without Kings & Nobles than with them . The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Govt . " Madison 's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States , as well as the Federal Government , from an establishment of religion , but the House did not pass them .

Minority leaders may engage in numerous activities to publicize their party 's priorities and to criticize the opposition 's . For instance , to keep their party colleagues " on message , " they insure that partisan colleagues are sent packets of suggested press releases or " talking points " for constituent meetings in their districts ; they help to organize " town meetings " in Members ' districts around the country to publicize the party 's agenda or a specific priority , such as health care or education ; they sponsor party " retreats " to discuss issues and assess the party 's public image ; they create " theme teams " to craft party messages that might be raised during the one-minute , morning hour , or special order period in the House ; they conduct surveys of party colleagues to discern their policy preferences ; they establish websites that highlight and distribute party images and issues to users ; and they organize task forces or issue teams to formulate party programs and to develop strategies for communicating these programs to the public .
The northwestern part of the South Asia , including Punjab , was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires , such as those of Tamerlane , Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan . Having conquered Drangiana , Arachosia , Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days , Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold , gems and pearls . However , Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains . Having taken a northeasterly direction , he marched against the Aspii ( mountaineers ) , who offered vigorous resistance , but were subdued . [ citation needed ] Alexander then marched through Ghazni , blockaded Magassa , and then marched to Ora and Bazira . Turning to the northeast , Alexander marched to Pucela , the capital of the district now known as Pakhli . He entered Western Punjab , where the ancient city of Nysa ( at the site of modern-day Mong ) was situated . A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians , the people of Multan , who were very skilful in war . Alexander invested many troops , eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle , and the city of Sagala ( present-day Sialkot ) was razed to the ground . Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C . and took his army to the heartlands of his empire . [ citation needed ]
Renaissance humanism was an activity of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors , book collectors , educators , and writers , who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as umanisti – " humanists " . It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries , and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education , which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic . Scholasticism focused on preparing men to be doctors , lawyers or professional theologians , and was taught from approved textbooks in logic , natural philosophy , medicine , law and theology . There were important centres of humanism at Florence , Naples , Rome , Venice , Mantua , Ferrara , and Urbino .
Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France . This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed , just a week before departure . Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time , despite being given the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home . [ citation needed ] In World War II , rivals who had combat service in the first great war ( led by Gen. Bernard Montgomery ) sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty , despite his stateside experience establishing a camp , completely equipped , for thousands of troops , and developing a full combat training schedule .
In the wake of the Republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . Augustus , the first Roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . So-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire . Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . This was the context for Rome 's conflict with Christianity , which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah 's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory . In 1933 , there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses in Germany , of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned . Of those , 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . In Canada , Jehovah 's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent . In the former Soviet Union , about 9,300 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951 . Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including China , Vietnam and some Islamic states .
Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired . Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans , while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism . In selecting a Chief Justice , Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives , noting privately that Warren " represents the kind of political , economic , and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court ... He has a national name for integrity , uprightness , and courage that , again , I believe we need on the Court " . In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court .
At the 2009 American Community Survey , Black Americans made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos . Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third ( 35.4 % ) of the Bronx 's population . Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8 % of the population . Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough , of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks . Over 61,000 people identified themselves as " Sub-Saharan African " in the survey , making up 4.4 % of the population .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament . The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections . In talks located in London that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower , when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections . In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria , and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S. , U.K. and France . At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called " Open Skies " to facilitate disarmament , which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other 's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America . The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement , Nicolaus Zinzendorf , the Moravian Church , Lutheran pietism , Presbyterianism and Puritanism . Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Harold John Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones .
Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured . All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host . An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin . Neither of these colonizations are considered infections . The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance . Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions , and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection . Some colonizing bacteria , such as Corynebacteria sp . and viridans streptococci , prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host , preventing infection and speeding wound healing .
Contemporary humanism entails a qualified optimism about the capacity of people , but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely good or that all people can live up to the Humanist ideals without help . If anything , there is recognition that living up to one 's potential is hard work and requires the help of others . The ultimate goal is human flourishing ; making life better for all humans , and as the most conscious species , also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole . The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now , and leaving the world a better place for those who come after . In 1925 , the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned : " The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled ; and man , who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels , has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature . It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts " .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .

A Vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and Roman matron and wife . Unlike male priests , Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of Rome .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta , goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame . A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction , public status and privileges , and could exercise considerable political influence . Upon entering her office , a Vestal was emancipated from her father 's authority . In archaic Roman society , these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man , instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus .
Punjab is Pakistan 's second largest province in terms of land area at 205,344 km2 ( 79,284 sq mi ) , after Balochistan , and is located at the north western edge of the geologic Indian plate in South Asia . The province is bordered by Kashmir ( Azad Kashmir , Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir , India ) to the northeast , the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east , the Pakistani province of Sindh to the south , the province of Balochistan to the southwest , the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the north .
Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader , the House Majority Leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House . Typically , the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . In some cases , Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker ; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert . In addition , Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor .
South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to South America 's distinctive marsupial faunas . The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean . Africa 's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea , cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean . Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia . Near the end of the Pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the Quaternary Period ) , the current ice age began . The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85 . The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . They were laid down in the Umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .

The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas , allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses . Mosaic murals , benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smoother and more even surface .
The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals . Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire : in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors . Ambrose , the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus 's request for tolerance . Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of Rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] He was the last emperor of both East and West .
Second , Democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status . Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern . In 1919 , for instance , Republicans bypassed James R. Mann , R-IL , who had been minority leader for eight years , and elected Frederick Gillett , R-MA , to be Speaker . Mann " had angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor ; " also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon , R-IL ( 1903–1911 ) , and many Members " suspected that he would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker . " More recently , although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections , he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign , including the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting day .
Believers in Pashupatinath ( mainly Hindus ) are allowed to enter the temple premises , but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River . The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka , South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla . This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam ( Unified India ) by encouraging cultural exchange . This procedure is followed in other temples around India , which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya .
Historically , the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient Armenia . The earliest attestations of the exonym Armenia date around the 6th century BC . In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC , Darius I the Great of Persia refers to Urashtu ( in Babylonian ) as Armina ( in Old Persian ; Armina ( ) and Harminuya ( in Elamite ) . In Greek , Αρμένιοι " Armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus ( 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians .
Despite its tropical wet and dry climate , extensive irrigation makes it a rich agricultural region . Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world . Wheat and cotton are the largest crops . Other crops include rice , sugarcane , millet , corn , oilseeds , pulses , vegetables , and fruits such as kinoo . Livestock and poultry production are also important . Despite past animosities , the rural masses in Punjab 's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting .
Multiracial Americans are also a sizable minority in the Bronx . People of multiracial heritage number over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and African American heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1 % of the population . People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1 % of the population .
The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up , as Europe , Greenland and North America drifted apart . In western North America , mountain building started in the Eocene , and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts . In Europe , the Tethys Sea finally vanished , while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant , the Mediterranean , and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north . Though the North Atlantic was opening , a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia , creating the Himalayan orogeny .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . Ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . Witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .
Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that " Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making . " Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles . They were diverse in style , rich in color and ornamental motifs , and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them , such as artsvagorgs ( eagle-carpets ) , vishapagorgs ( dragon-carpets ) and otsagorgs ( serpent-carpets ) . The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches , " covered with vegatative ornaments " , and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh .
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
Mosaic has a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine . Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance , though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique . Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics .
In 1758 , the general of the Hindu Maratha Empire , Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Attock . Timur Shah Durrani , the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali , was driven out of Punjab . Lahore , Multan , Dera Ghazi Khan , Kashmir and other subahs on the south and eastern side of Peshawar were under the Maratha rule for the most part . In Punjab and Kashmir , the Marathas were now major players . The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 1761 , Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded the Maratha territory of Punjab and captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and re-consolidated control over them .
Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the drachma . After signing the Maastricht Treaty , Greece applied to join the eurozone . The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of GDP . Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . On 1 January 2001 , Greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . However , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002 . This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 March 2012 .
The Bronx 's highest elevation at 280 feet ( 85 m ) is in the northwest corner , west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School . The opposite ( southeastern ) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or " necks " of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh : Hunt 's Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck and Throg 's Neck . Further up the coastline , Rodman 's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island . The Bronx 's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles ( 194 km2 ) .
Serological methods are highly sensitive , specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms . These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen . The antigen , usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent , is bound by the antibody . This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways , dependent upon the test . For example , " Strep throat " is often diagnosed within minutes , and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent , S. pyogenes , that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab . Serological tests , if available , are usually the preferred route of identification , however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration . Some serological methods are extremely costly , although when commonly used , such as with the " strep test " , they can be inexpensive .
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders . When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah 's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt , provide help and possibly administer discipline . Disfellowshipping , a form of shunning , is the strongest form of discipline , administered to an offender deemed unrepentant . Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home , and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement ; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged . Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that " losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [ the shunned individual ] to come 'to his senses , ' see the seriousness of his wrong , and take steps to return to Jehovah . " The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior . Members who disassociate ( formally resign ) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned . Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced . Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin ; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service , but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship . Marking , a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship , is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin .

In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede , Santa Maria in Domnica , Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura , Santa Cecilia in Trastevere , Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano . The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics . They were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . Another great work of Pope Leo , the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna , depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side , and SS . Susanna and Felicity on the other . It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . Pope Paschal I ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
By the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state , with a large plebeian , artisan class excluded from the old patrician gentes and from the state priesthoods . The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours ; according to tradition , Rome 's Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine ; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter , Juno and Minerva , installed in a Capitoline temple , built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival , Epulum Jovis . These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned , as if noble guests , at their own inaugural banquet .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of first-century Christianity . Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body , which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture . The Governing Body does not issue any single , comprehensive " statement of faith " , but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society . Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation , in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose , and that such enlightenment or " new light " results from the application of reason and study , the guidance of the holy spirit , and direction from Jesus Christ and angels . The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern " deep truths " , which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions . The religion 's leadership , while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility , is said to provide " divine guidance " through its teachings described as " based on God 's Word thus ... not from men , but from Jehovah . "
Russell moved the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters to Brooklyn , New York , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel . He identified the religious movement as " Bible Students , " and more formally as the International Bible Students Association . By 1910 , about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re-elected him annually as their " pastor . " Russell died October 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour .
The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma . Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia . The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow . Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high . Laurentia , Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia . Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole . Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere , and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean , Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
Romulus was credited with several religious institutions . He founded the Consualia festival , inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate ; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus 's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome 's myth of origins . As a successful general , Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome 's first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the spolia opima , the prime spoils taken in war , in the celebration of the first Roman triumph . Spared a mortal 's death , Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified .

Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of Latin , such as Cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the Greek equivalent Paideia . Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century Italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . Modern scholars , however , point out that Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . For Cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks . The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets , saints and patriarchs . Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an Emperor kneeling before Christ ( late 9th or early 10th century ) . Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine . Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand . Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded . A mosaic panel on the gallery shows Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe ( 1042–1055 ) . The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church .
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence . During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones . Almost nothing of them survived except the " Ascension of Christ " in the Latin Chapel ( now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics ) . More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ , Councils of the Church and angels . In the apses the Annunciation , the Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen . The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor , the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church .
Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots . Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva . He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there . Despite heavy persecution , the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment . French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character , made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s . This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts , known as the French Wars of Religion . The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559 . Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time , illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of August 1572 , when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France . The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes , promising official toleration of the Protestant minority , but under highly restricted conditions . Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion , and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century , culminating in Louis XIV 's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again . In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau , Frederick William I , Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam , giving free passage to Huguenot refugees . In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England , the Netherlands , Prussia , Switzerland , and the English and Dutch overseas colonies . A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region .
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty . A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064 . They settled in large numbers in Cilicia , an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times . In 1080 , they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia , which became the focus of Armenian nationalism . The Armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby Crusader States , but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions . In the next few centuries , Djenghis Khan , Timurids , and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians .
In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
In the Presidential primary elections of February 5 , 2008 , Sen. Clinton won 61.2 % of the Bronx 's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8 % for Barack Obama and 1.0 % for the other four candidates combined ( John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Bill Richardson and Joe Biden ) . On the same day , John McCain won 54.4 % of the borough 's 5,643 Republican votes , Mitt Romney 20.8 % , Mike Huckabee 8.2 % , Ron Paul 7.4 % , Rudy Giuliani 5.6 % , and the other candidates ( Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes ) 3.6 % between them .
The First Great Awakening was an evangelical and revitalization movement that swept through Protestant Europe and British America , especially the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s , leaving a permanent impact on American Protestantism . It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ . Pulling away from ritual , ceremony , sacramentalism and hierarchy , it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption , and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
On July 26 , 1931 , at a convention in Columbus , Ohio , Rutherford introduced the new name—Jehovah 's witnesses—based on Isaiah 43:10 : " Ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , and my servant whom I have chosen " —which was adopted by resolution . The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society , as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods . In 1932 , Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 , introduced what he called a " theocratic " ( literally , God-ruled ) organizational system , under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters .
Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots . Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva . He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there . Despite heavy persecution , the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment .

Like other neighborhoods in New York City , the South Bronx has no official boundaries . The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham Road was often used as a northern limit . The Bronx River more consistently forms an eastern boundary . The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi-unit homes . The South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse , Borough Hall , and other government buildings , as well as Yankee Stadium . The Cross Bronx Expressway bisects it , east to west . The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County , one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York . The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers , Eastchester , and Pelham . In 1846 , a new town , West Farms , was created by division of Westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of Morrisania was created from West Farms . In 1873 , the town of Kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge , Riverdale , and Woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of Yonkers .
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
From 1932 , it was taught that the " little flock " of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon . Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144,000 " anointed " who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ , a separate class of members , the " great multitude , " would live in a paradise restored on earth ; from 1935 , new converts to the movement were considered part of that class . By the mid-1930s , the timing of the beginning of Christ 's presence ( Greek : parousía ) , his enthronement as king , and the start of the " last days " were each moved to 1914 .
There are several major exceptions on tuition fees . In many European countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . Public universities in Nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . Denmark , Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . Citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
From 1879 , Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically . Thirty congregations were founded , and during 1879 and 1880 , Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings . As congregations continued to form during Russell 's ministry , they each remained self-administrative , functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance . In 1881 , Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley , and in 1884 , Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles . By about 1900 , Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs , and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices . By the 1910s , Russell 's organization maintained nearly a hundred " pilgrims , " or traveling preachers . Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry , and by 1912 , he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States .
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute , in the form of the Heinrich Heine Memorial , better known as the Lorelei Fountain from one of Heine 's best-known works ( 1838 ) . After Heine 's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected , allegedly for anti-Semitic motives , a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet ( 1797–1856 ) , his incensed German-American admirers , including Carl Schurz , started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan , at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street . However , this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism , aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art .
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article , " Preventive police " in the London Review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . The reason , argued Chadwick , was that " A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation . " In contrast to a deterrent of punishment , a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - " crime does n't pay " . In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act , the " object " of the new Metropolitan Police , was changed by Robert Peel to the " principal object , " which was the " prevention of crime . " Later historians would attribute the perception of England 's " appearance of orderliness and love of public order " to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel 's police system .
Since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the Bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " Ten-Year Housing Plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units . The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos ' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx . The IRT White Plains Road Line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . Chains such as Marshalls , Staples , and Target opened stores in the Bronx . More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
Since then , tourism in Nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu 's religious sites such as Pashupatinath , Swayambhunath , Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha . From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000 . Following the end of the Maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . Since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic . In economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa , Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily . Once Mussolini , the Italian leader , had fallen in Italy , the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche . But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians , the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country – making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of Italy was highly successful .
Greece 's rail network is estimated to be at 2,548 km . Rail transport in Greece is operated by TrainOSE , a subsidiary of the Hellenic Railways Organization ( OSE ) . Most of the country 's network is standard gauge ( 1,565 km ) , while the country also has 983 km of narrow gauge . A total of 764 km of rail are electrified . Greece has rail connections with Bulgaria , the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey . A total of three suburban railway systems ( Proastiakos ) are in operation ( in Athens , Thessaloniki and Patras ) , while one metro system is operational in Athens with another under construction .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the English language in this sense . The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when German historian and philologist Georg Voigt used humanism to describe Renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the Italian Renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially Italy .
European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( scholae monasticae ) , in which monks and nuns taught classes ; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century . The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools . It is possible , however , that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare , with the University of Paris being an exception . Later they were also founded by Kings ( University of Naples Federico II , Charles University in Prague , Jagiellonian University in Kraków ) or municipal administrations ( University of Cologne , University of Erfurt ) . In the early medieval period , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools , usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education . Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries .
Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice ( mainly from the 17th–19th centuries , but the oldest one from 1270–75 , " The burial of St Mark in the first basilica " ) , the Cathedral of Orvieto ( golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century , many times redone ) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca ( huge , striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below , designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century ) . The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the Blessing Christ ( signed by one Solsternus from 1207 ) .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
Gephardt added that " inclusion and empowerment of the people on the line have to be done to get the best performance " from the minority party . Other techniques for fostering party harmony include the appointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with conflicting views to reach consensus on issues ; the creation of new leadership positions as a way to reach out and involve a greater diversity of partisans in the leadership structure ; and daily meetings in the Leader 's office ( or at breakfast , lunch , or dinner ) to lay out floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party .
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine 's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt . Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine 's Monastery is exceptional . On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background . In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background . The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets , and two contemporary figure , " Abbot Longinos " and " John the Deacon " . The mosaic was probably created in 565/6 .

Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
There are several major exceptions on tuition fees . In many European countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . Public universities in Nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . Denmark , Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . Citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community . Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta 's flame . The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home . Besides their own festival of Vestalia , they participated directly in the rites of Parilia , Parentalia and Fordicidia . Indirectly , they played a role in every official sacrifice ; among their duties was the preparation of the mola salsa , the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation .
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence . During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones . Almost nothing of them survived except the " Ascension of Christ " in the Latin Chapel ( now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics ) . More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ , Councils of the Church and angels . In the apses the Annunciation , the Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen . The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor , the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
Davies identifies Paine 's The Age of Reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical , historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach . " The first is political , largely French in inspiration , and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty ' . The second is philosophical , German , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . Homo homini deus est ( " The human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , Feuerbach had written .
On July 26 , 1931 , at a convention in Columbus , Ohio , Rutherford introduced the new name—Jehovah 's witnesses—based on Isaiah 43:10 : " Ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , and my servant whom I have chosen " —which was adopted by resolution . The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society , as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods . In 1932 , Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 , introduced what he called a " theocratic " ( literally , God-ruled ) organizational system , under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters .
Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence . Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement , since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators . This practice is controversial , with for example , New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers .
During Soviet rule , Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions . The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . In football , their most successful team was Yerevan 's FC Ararat , which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like FC Bayern Munich in the Euro cup .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago . Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations , including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ , both in the United States and elsewhere . There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide , and the movement is growing in many parts of the world , especially the global South . Since the 1960s , Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions , and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement . Together , Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents .
In the later Imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped . Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica . The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; St Augustine ( following St Ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567 . Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . As a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . Also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . As a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .

Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
Traditionally , the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the House , with the Majority Leader as second-in-command . For instance , when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections , Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader . Despite this , Cantor and his successor , Kevin McCarthy , have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House , since Boehner is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans . However , there have been some exceptions . The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006 . In contrast , the Minority Leader is the undisputed leader of the minority party .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
The Earth of the early Archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . During this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
In 1962 , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of officially-sponsored prayer or religious recitations in public schools . In Engel v. Vitale , 370 U.S. 421 ( 1962 ) , the Court , by a vote of 6-1 , determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools , even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation . ( The prayer required by the New York State Board of Regents prior to the Court 's decision consisted of : " Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee , and we beg Thy blessings upon us , our parents , our teachers , and our country . Amen . " ) As the Court stated :
There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic : opus vermiculatum used tiny tesserae , typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less , and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support . The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail , and an approach to the illusionism of painting . Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work . The normal technique was opus tessellatum , using larger tesserae , which was laid on site . There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background , which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work .
Despite the lack of a coastline , Punjab is the most industrialised province of Pakistan ; its manufacturing industries produce textiles , sports goods , heavy machinery , electrical appliances , surgical instruments , vehicles , auto parts , metals , sugar mill plants , aircraft , cement , agricultural machinery , bicycles and rickshaws , floor coverings , and processed foods . In 2003 , the province manufactured 90 % of the paper and paper boards , 71 % of the fertilizers , 69 % of the sugar and 40 % of the cement of Pakistan .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time , a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , only 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville , Dauphin County , Pennsylvania . In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service . In retirement , the former president did not completely retreat from political life ; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg . However , his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as " a dime-store New Dealer " .
But in the mid-18th century , during the French Enlightenment , a more ideological use of the term had come into use . In 1765 , the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of " The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us , and which we will venture to call 'humanism ' , for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing " . The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots " philanthropic " and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge ( some Christian , some not ) . After the French Revolution , the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions , attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau , was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives , such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre , as a deification or idolatry of humanity . Humanism began to acquire a negative sense . The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word " humanism " by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the " mere humanity " ( as opposed to the divine nature ) of Christ , i.e. , Unitarians and Deists . In this polarised atmosphere , in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise , universal schooling , and the like , liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity . The anarchist Proudhon ( best known for declaring that " property is theft " ) used the word " humanism " to describe a " culte , déification de l’humanité " ( " worship , deification of humanity " ) and Ernest Renan in L’avenir de la science : pensées de 1848 ( " The Future of Knowledge : Thoughts on 1848 " ) ( 1848–49 ) , states : " It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future , that is , the cult of all that pertains to humanity—all of life , sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value . "
Just as artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci – partaking of the zeitgeist though not himself a humanist – advocated study of human anatomy , nature , and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art , so Spanish-born humanist Juan Luis Vives ( c. 1493–1540 ) advocated observation , craft , and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities , helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism . Thus , the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to natural philosophy , based on empirical observations and experimentation of the physical universe , making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance .
This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement .
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
Like the Speaker of the House , the Minority Leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position . When Nancy Pelosi , D-CA , became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress , she had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress . When her predecessor , Richard Gephardt , D-MO , became minority leader in the 104th House , he had been in the House for almost 20 years , had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years , had been a 1988 presidential candidate , and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections . Gephardt 's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel , R-IL , who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House . Michel 's predecessor , Republican John Rhodes of Arizona , was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service .
A series of low-lying annexes ( largely hidden ) flank both ends . Also in the square are the glass-faced Planalto Palace housing the presidential offices , and the Palace of the Supreme Court . Farther east , on a triangle of land jutting into the lake , is the Palace of the Dawn ( Palácio da Alvorada ; the presidential residence ) . Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city 's cathedral , considered by many to be Niemeyer 's finest achievement ( see photographs of the interior ) . The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports , which join in a circle 115 feet ( 35 meters ) above the floor of the nave ; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass . The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways . Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace , Itamaraty Palace , the National Theater , and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture . The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings .
A loblolly pine , known as the " Eisenhower Pine " , was located on Augusta 's 17th hole , approximately 210 yards ( 192 m ) from the Masters tee . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , an Augusta National member , hit the tree so many times that , at a 1956 club meeting , he proposed that it be cut down . Not wanting to offend the president , the club 's chairman , Clifford Roberts , immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request . The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage .
The Armenian Highland lies in the highlands surrounding Mount Ararat , the highest peak of the region . In the Bronze Age , several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia , including the Hittite Empire ( at the height of its power ) , Mitanni ( South-Western historical Armenia ) , and Hayasa-Azzi ( 1600–1200 BC ) . Soon after Hayasa-Azzi were Arme-Shupria ( 1300s–1190 BC ) , the Nairi ( 1400–1000 BC ) and the Kingdom of Urartu ( 860–590 BC ) , who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland . Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people . Under Ashurbanipal ( 669–627 BC ) , the Assyrian empire reached the Caucasus Mountains ( modern Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan ) .
By the end of the early modern period , the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context . Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging . The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture , and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
Kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . The average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley : south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City ( Patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by Kirtipur Municipality and to the east by Madyapur Thimi Municipality . To the north the urban area extends into several Village Development Committees . However , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley .
Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas , although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers , rather than the madrasa itself , granted the license or degree . Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Hossein Nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval Islamic madrasahs became universities . George Makdisi and others , however , argue that the European university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world . Other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics .
European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( scholae monasticae ) , in which monks and nuns taught classes ; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century . The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools . It is possible , however , that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare , with the University of Paris being an exception . Later they were also founded by Kings ( University of Naples Federico II , Charles University in Prague , Jagiellonian University in Kraków ) or municipal administrations ( University of Cologne , University of Erfurt ) . In the early medieval period , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools , usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education . Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries .
Tourism is considered another important industry in Nepal . This industry started around 1950 , as the country 's political makeup changed and ended the country 's isolation from the rest of the world . In 1956 , air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway , between Kathmandu and Raxaul ( at India 's border ) , was started . Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity ; some of these include the Tourism Development Board , the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department . Furthermore , Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations . Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity . The hotel industry , travel agencies , training of tourist guides , and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal , and in Kathmandu in particular .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942 . Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . He organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . Knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding Witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu , near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building . This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa . It is the most important museum in the country , housing an extensive collection of weapons , art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance . The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons , and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana , meaning " the stone house of arms and ammunition " . Given its focus , the museum contains many weapons , including locally made firearms used in wars , leather cannons from the 18th–19th century , and medieval and modern works in wood , bronze , stone and paintings .
Haruspicy was also used in public cult , under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate . The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice , particularly the liver . They also interpreted omens , prodigies and portents , and formulated their expiation . Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient , ethnically Etruscan " outsider " religious profession , separate from Rome 's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy , essential but never quite respectable . During the mid-to-late Republic , the reformist Gaius Gracchus , the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla , and the " notorious Verres " justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners . The senate and armies used the public haruspices : at some time during the late Republic , the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination . Being of independent means , they would be better motivated to maintain a pure , religious practice for the public good . The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect : none of this seems to have troubled Marius , who employed a Syrian prophetess .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
As of 2010 , 46.29 % ( 584,463 ) of Bronx residents aged five and older spoke Spanish at home , while 44.02 % ( 555,767 ) spoke English , 2.48 % ( 31,361 ) African languages , 0.91 % ( 11,455 ) French , 0.90 % ( 11,355 ) Italian , 0.87 % ( 10,946 ) various Indic languages , 0.70 % ( 8,836 ) other Indo-European languages , and Chinese was spoken at home by 0.50 % ( 6,610 ) of the population over the age of five . In total , 55.98 % ( 706,783 ) of the Bronx 's population age five and older spoke a language at home other than English . A Garifuna-speaking community from Honduras and Guatemala also makes the Bronx its home .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
In 1566 , the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited . By the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . On July 9 , 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order . In 1808 , the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil , because of the French invasion of Portugal . King João VI established the " Intendência Geral de Polícia " ( General Police Intendancy ) for investigations . He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809 . In 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 .
In the wake of religious riots in Egypt , the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to " ancestral gods " or suffer a penalty : only Jews were exempt . Decius ' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults ; no ancestral gods were specified by name . The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman . Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective ; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults , but apostasy was sought , rather than capital punishment . A year after its due deadline , the edict expired .
The neighbourhood of Thamel is Kathmandu 's primary " traveller 's ghetto " , packed with guest houses , restaurants , shops , and bookstores , catering to tourists . Another neighbourhood of growing popularity is Jhamel , a name for Jhamsikhel coined to rhyme with Thamel . Jhochhen Tol , also known as Freak Street , is Kathmandu 's original traveler 's haunt , made popular by the hippies of the 1960s and 1970s ; it remains a popular alternative to Thamel . Asan is a bazaar and ceremonial square on the old trade route to Tibet , and provides a fine example of a traditional neighbourhood .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century , and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement ( 1140 ) . The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary , St John and the two patron saints , Cipriano and Cipriana . When the church was demolished in the 19th century , the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia . It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
In his book , Humanism ( 1997 ) , Tony Davies calls these critics " humanist anti-humanists " . Critics of antihumanism , most notably Jürgen Habermas , counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism 's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal , they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own . Others , like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks , but thought humanism applied only to the German " race " and specifically to the Nazis and thus , in Davies ' words , were anti-humanist humanists . Such a reading of Heidegger 's thought is itself deeply controversial ; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism . Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century " it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man ' or the 'triumph of human reason ' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them " . For " it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason " . Yet , he continues , " it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms . For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution . The freedom to speak and write , to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests , to protest and disobey : all these can only be articulated in humanist terms . "
With high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . Rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( CAD ) software can be assembled by a robot . Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . But these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . With robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of Internet use , with the gap closing rapidly in recent years . The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , from 23 % to 56 % respectively ( compared with an EU average of 49 % and 79 % ) . At the same time , there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection , from 4 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2013 ( compared with an EU average of 30 % and 76 % ) . However , Greece also has the EU 's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet : 36 % in 2013 , down from 65 % in 2006 ( compared with an EU average of 21 % and 42 % ) .
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma . During the Silurian , Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation . The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Rheic Ocean , a seaway of Iapetus Ocean ( now in between Avalonia and Laurentia ) , and newly formed Ural Ocean .
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan ( 1906–1955 ) . It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings , letters and papers , memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members . The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to king Mahendra of Nepal ( 1920–1972 ) . Like the Tribhuvan Museum , it includes his personal belongings such as decorations , stamps , coins and personal notes and manuscripts , but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber . The Hanumandhoka Palace , a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar , contains three separate museums of historic importance . These museums include the Birendra museum , which contains items related to the second-last monarch , Birendra of Nepal .
The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan . It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books . English , Nepali , Sanskrit , Hindi , and Nepal Bhasa books are found here . The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD . Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library , located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building . This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana . It covers a wide range of subjects including history , law , art , religion , and philosophy , as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra , which is believed to be over 1,000 years old . The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building , and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated .
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . In 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns .
By the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state , with a large plebeian , artisan class excluded from the old patrician gentes and from the state priesthoods . The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours ; according to tradition , Rome 's Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine ; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter , Juno and Minerva , installed in a Capitoline temple , built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival , Epulum Jovis . These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned , as if noble guests , at their own inaugural banquet .
According to the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-Hispanic Black or African American , 10.9 % of the population was non-Hispanic White , 3.4 % non-Hispanic Asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-Hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-Hispanic ) . The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
As the election approached , other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president . In January 1948 , after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention , Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was " not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office " ; " life-long professional soldiers " , he wrote , " in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason , [ should ] abstain from seeking high political office " . Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time . Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president ; Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the other probable winner , would presumably serve two terms , and Eisenhower , at age 66 in 1956 , would then be too old .
In addition , the minority leader has a number of other institutional functions . For instance , the minority leader is sometimes statutorily authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities ; he or she and the majority leader each name three Members to serve as Private Calendar objectors ; he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening the House per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent adjournment resolutions ; he or she is a traditional member of the House Office Building Commission ; he or she is a member of the United States Capitol Preservation Commission ; and he or she may , after consultation with the Speaker , convene an early organizational party caucus or conference . Informally , the minority leader maintains ties with majority party leaders to learn about the schedule and other House matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as feasible .
In recent years a number of well-known tourism-related organizations have placed Greek destinations in the top of their lists . In 2009 Lonely Planet ranked Thessaloniki , the country 's second-largest city , the world 's fifth best " Ultimate Party Town " , alongside cities such as Montreal and Dubai , while in 2011 the island of Santorini was voted as the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure . The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe . Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014 .
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .
The mosaics of St. Peter 's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri , Guido Reni , Domenichino , Carlo Maratta , and many others . Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the Transfiguration . Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter 's , including Giovanni Battista Calandra , Fabio Cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and Pietro Paolo Cristofari ( died 1743 ) . Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite Bronx High School of Science , Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music , DeWitt Clinton High School , High School for Violin and Dance , Bronx Leadership Academy 2 , Bronx International High School , the School for Excellence , the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study , Wings Academy for young adults , The Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice , Validus Preparatory Academy , The Eagle Academy For Young Men , Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School , Bronx Academy of Letters , Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School of American Studies . The Bronx is also home to three of New York City 's most prestigious private , secular schools : Fieldston , Horace Mann , and Riverdale Country School .
There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide , [ ad ] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians . [ ae ] In 2010 , a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa , 260 million in the Americas , 140 million in Asia-Pacific region , 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa . Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population . Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world 's Christians at 33 % , 36 % , 36.7 % , and 40 % , while in relation to the world 's population at 11.6 % and 13 % .
All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge , and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions . Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends . The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
Protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . In the nineteenth century , throughout the Anglo-American world , numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . As an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . To Bismarck this was " practical Christianity " . These programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the Western world .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
On March 31 , 2010 , the YouTube website launched a new design , with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site . Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented : " We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter . " In May 2010 , it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day , which it described as " nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined " . In May 2011 , YouTube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day . In January 2012 , YouTube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day .
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . Among these groups , many Irish Americans , Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here . In addition , French , German , Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . The Jewish population also increased notably during this time . In 1937 , according to Jewish organizations , 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011 . Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . In this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut .
Eisenhower 's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations , a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan , and The American Assembly , Eisenhower 's " vision of a great cultural center where business , professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature " . His biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as " the political education of General Eisenhower " , since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational , administrative , and financial demands for the university . Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations , he also gained exposure to economic analysis , which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy . " Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics , he has learned at the study group meetings , " one Aid to Europe member claimed .
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( crossreacting ) , or by vaccination . Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens . There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .
The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( Tennessee Constitution Article IX , Section 2 is one such example . ) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me God . " In some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . At one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( " all the sea " ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean . The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age ; in the U.S. , these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup . Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass , Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in Western Europe , where the Triassic was first studied . In North America , for example , marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west . Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments , such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates .
Bronx native Nancy Savoca 's 1989 comedy , True Love , explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding . The film , which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple , won the Grand Jury Prize at that year 's Sundance Film Festival . The CBS television sitcom Becker , 1998–2004 , was more ambiguous . The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker , a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients , co-workers , friends , and practically everything and everybody else in his world . It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx .
Prior to his inauguration , Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the Korean War to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy . His inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations .
The minority leader has a number of formal and informal party responsibilities . Formally , the rules of each party specify certain roles and responsibilities for their leader . For example , under Democratic rules for the 106th Congress , the minority leader may call meetings of the Democratic Caucus . He or she is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ; names the members of the Democratic Leadership Council ; chairs the Policy Committee ; and heads the Steering Committee . Examples of other assignments are making " recommendations to the Speaker on all Democratic Members who shall serve as conferees " and nominating party members to the Committees on Rules and House Administration . Republican rules identify generally comparable functions for their top party leader .
Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances . Some rituals specifically required the presence of women , but their active participation was limited . As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice , the central rite of most major public ceremonies . In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals , some cult practices were reserved for women only . The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely . Because women enter the public record less frequently than men , their religious practices are less known , and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias . A host of deities , however , are associated with motherhood . Juno , Diana , Lucina , and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent .
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced : some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred . Others complied . Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian , but powerful and influential ; and some provincial authorities were lenient , notably the Caesar in Gaul , Constantius Chlorus , the father of Constantine I. Diocletian 's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311 , when he asked Christians to pray for him . " This meant an ofﬁcial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire , although one of the tetrarchs , Maximinus Daia , still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313 . "
The development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between New England and New York ( Manhattan ) . Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule . Kingsbridge , built in 1693 where Broadway reached the Spuyten Duyvil Creek , was a possession of Frederick Philipse , lord of Philipse Manor . The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek . In 1759 , the farmers led by Jacobus Dyckman and Benjamin Palmer built a " free bridge " across the Harlem River which led to the abandonment of tolls altogether .
Romulus was credited with several religious institutions . He founded the Consualia festival , inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate ; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus 's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome 's myth of origins . As a successful general , Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome 's first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the spolia opima , the prime spoils taken in war , in the celebration of the first Roman triumph . Spared a mortal 's death , Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified .
During the Eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago ) , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . At the beginning of the period , Australia and Antarctica remained connected , and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters , distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high . But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma , the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica , and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents . The Antarctic region cooled down , and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze , sending cold water and ice floes north , reinforcing the cooling . The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago . [ citation needed ]
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years ( Deflem , 2002 ) . For example , in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals . A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London . The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe , which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War . There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) . It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception . It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( Sheptycki , 2000 ) .
Since the 19th century , many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or " gatekeeper " , sometimes described as the President 's Private Secretary , sometimes with no official title at all . Eisenhower formalized this role , introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army . Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position . Initially , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff , but each eventually appointed one .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time , a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , only 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville , Dauphin County , Pennsylvania . In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service . In retirement , the former president did not completely retreat from political life ; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg . However , his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as " a dime-store New Dealer " .
A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement . Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots , it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles . From there it spread around the world , carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there . These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history , such as seen in the two Great Awakenings . Pentecostalism , which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations , continues to be an important force in Western Christianity .
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( Amendment XIV ) is one of the post-Civil War amendments , intended to secure rights for former slaves . It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others . The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states . While it has not been fully implemented , the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure , through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause , the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states .
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
With high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . Rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( CAD ) software can be assembled by a robot . Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . But these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . With robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta , goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame . A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction , public status and privileges , and could exercise considerable political influence . Upon entering her office , a Vestal was emancipated from her father 's authority . In archaic Roman society , these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man , instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus .
The northwestern part of the South Asia , including Punjab , was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires , such as those of Tamerlane , Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan . Having conquered Drangiana , Arachosia , Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days , Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold , gems and pearls . However , Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains . Having taken a northeasterly direction , he marched against the Aspii ( mountaineers ) , who offered vigorous resistance , but were subdued . [ citation needed ] Alexander then marched through Ghazni , blockaded Magassa , and then marched to Ora and Bazira . Turning to the northeast , Alexander marched to Pucela , the capital of the district now known as Pakhli . He entered Western Punjab , where the ancient city of Nysa ( at the site of modern-day Mong ) was situated . A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians , the people of Multan , who were very skilful in war . Alexander invested many troops , eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle , and the city of Sagala ( present-day Sialkot ) was razed to the ground . Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C . and took his army to the heartlands of his empire . [ citation needed ]
By contrast , Tom Wolfe 's Bonfire of the Vanities ( 1987 ) portrays a wealthy , white protagonist , Sherman McCoy , getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals . A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse . However , times change , and in 2007 , the New York Times reported that " the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman 's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments . " In the same article , the Reverend Al Sharpton ( whose fictional analogue in the novel is " Reverend Bacon " ) asserts that " twenty years later , the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe 's wardrobe . "
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas , allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses . Mosaic murals , benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smoother and more even surface .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
The Bronx 's highest elevation at 280 feet ( 85 m ) is in the northwest corner , west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School . The opposite ( southeastern ) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or " necks " of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh : Hunt 's Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck and Throg 's Neck . Further up the coastline , Rodman 's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island . The Bronx 's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles ( 194 km2 ) .

In the course of this religious upheaval , the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 swept through the Bavarian , Thuringian and Swabian principalities . After the Eighty Years ' War in the Low Countries and the French Wars of Religion , the confessional division of the states of the Holy Roman Empire eventually erupted in the Thirty Years ' War between 1618 and 1648 . It devastated much of Germany , killing between 25 % and 40 % of its population . The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , were :
In June 2007 , YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom , which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . The system , which became known as Content ID , creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . When a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .

Until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the German university model had spread around the world . Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . In Britain , the move from Industrial Revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray ( chairman of the University Grants Committee ) and Sir Samuel Curran , with the formation of the University of Strathclyde . The British also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in Europe .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
With the initial investment of £4,200 , the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades , of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and " on the game . " The force was a success after its first year , and his men had " established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives . " Word of this success spread quickly , and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800 , transforming it from a private to public police agency ; now the oldest police force in the world . Colquhoun published a book on the experiment , The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames . It found receptive audiences far outside London , and inspired similar forces in other cities , notably , New York City , Dublin , and Sydney .
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . For example , humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body , grows and multiplies . This is referred to as colonization . Most humans are not easily infected . Those who are weak , sick , malnourished , have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections . Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections . Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface , generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity , nose , eyes , genitalia , anus , or the microbe can enter through open wounds . While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry , many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs . Some pathogens grow within the host cells ( intracellular ) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article , " Preventive police " in the London Review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . The reason , argued Chadwick , was that " A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation . " In contrast to a deterrent of punishment , a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - " crime does n't pay " . In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act , the " object " of the new Metropolitan Police , was changed by Robert Peel to the " principal object , " which was the " prevention of crime . " Later historians would attribute the perception of England 's " appearance of orderliness and love of public order " to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel 's police system .
Robert N. Bellah has in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States . He used the term " Civil Religion " to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States . His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy : " Considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word 'God ' at all ? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . "
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi ( which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan ) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country . Punjabi is the provincial language of Punjab . There is not a single district in the province where Punjabi language is mother-tongue of less than 89 % of population . The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level . Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes , clans ( Urdu : برادری‎ ) and communities . In Pakistani Punjab these tribes have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications . Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include Majhi ( Standard ) , Saraiki and Hindko . Saraiki is mostly spoken in south Punjab , and Pashto , spoken in some parts of north west Punjab , especially in Attock District and Mianwali District .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Steven Waldman notes that ; " The evangelicals provided the political muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson , not merely because they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep the spiritual and secular worlds apart . " " Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners , " writes the historian Frank Lambert in his book The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America . " New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state . "
Praça dos Três Poderes ( Portuguese for Square of the Three Powers ) is a plaza in Brasília . The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza : the Executive , represented by the Palácio do Planalto ( presidential office ) ; the Legislative , represented by the National Congress ( Congresso Nacional ) ; and the Judicial branch , represented by the Supreme Federal Court ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) . It is a tourist attraction in Brasília , designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously .

The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite Bronx High School of Science , Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music , DeWitt Clinton High School , High School for Violin and Dance , Bronx Leadership Academy 2 , Bronx International High School , the School for Excellence , the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study , Wings Academy for young adults , The Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice , Validus Preparatory Academy , The Eagle Academy For Young Men , Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School , Bronx Academy of Letters , Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School of American Studies . The Bronx is also home to three of New York City 's most prestigious private , secular schools : Fieldston , Horace Mann , and Riverdale Country School .
Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings , a far more prestigious artform , and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos . Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek , suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire ; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves . Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa , in places such as Carthage , and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis , Tunisia .
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods , so did some individual Romans . In the mid-to-late Republican era , and probably much earlier , many of Rome 's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult , along with a share of their divinity . Most notably in the very late Republic , the Julii claimed Venus Genetrix as ancestor ; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult . The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil 's poetic , Imperial vision of the past .
According to Eurostat , Greece 's largest port by tons of goods transported in 2010 is the port of Aghioi Theodoroi , with 17.38 million tons . The Port of Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons , followed by the Port of Piraeus , with 13.2 million tons , and the port of Eleusis , with 12.37 million tons . The total number of goods transported through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million tons , a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the country in 2007 . Since then , Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean 's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO . In 2013 , Piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages . The objective is to start a regular " Bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " Field Service Report " . Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive " .
On January 17 , 1961 , Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office . In his farewell speech , Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces . He described the Cold War : " We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ... " and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that " we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military–industrial complex . "
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “extinct in the wild” to “vulnerable” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
Others , such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . However , the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
In January 2010 , YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard . This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed . The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial . Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the H.264 or WebM formats could play the videos , and not all videos on the site were available .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures ; in principle , Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin , Etruscan and other Italian peoples , cults and deities as Roman . Those who acknowledged Rome 's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars , independent of Roman religious law . Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis . Autonomy and concord were official policy , but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models . Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages , especially to local elites . All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia . By the middle of the 1st century AD , Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established , Romanised cult nearby : by the end of that century , Sabratha’s so-called tophet was no longer in use . Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome 's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice , not a centralised legal requirement . Major cult centres to " non-Roman " deities continued to prosper : notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium , the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo 's sacred wood at Antioch .
The northwestern part of the South Asia , including Punjab , was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires , such as those of Tamerlane , Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan . Having conquered Drangiana , Arachosia , Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days , Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold , gems and pearls . However , Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains . Having taken a northeasterly direction , he marched against the Aspii ( mountaineers ) , who offered vigorous resistance , but were subdued . [ citation needed ] Alexander then marched through Ghazni , blockaded Magassa , and then marched to Ora and Bazira . Turning to the northeast , Alexander marched to Pucela , the capital of the district now known as Pakhli . He entered Western Punjab , where the ancient city of Nysa ( at the site of modern-day Mong ) was situated . A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians , the people of Multan , who were very skilful in war . Alexander invested many troops , eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle , and the city of Sagala ( present-day Sialkot ) was razed to the ground . Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C . and took his army to the heartlands of his empire . [ citation needed ]
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties , including the power of reason . That means that they are allowed to explore God 's creation and , according to Genesis 2:15 , make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way . Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences . Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers , in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ , are to follow God 's commandments . Industry , frugality , calling , discipline , and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code . In particular , Calvin rejected luxury . Therefore , craftsmen , industrialists , and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology . As a result , productivity grew , which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages . In this way , the economy , the sciences , and technology reinforced each other . The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors . The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution . This idea is also known as the " Protestant ethic thesis . "
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " I give that you might give . " Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .
Institute of Medicine , the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is located in Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . It was established in 1972 and started to impart medical education from 1978 . A number of medical colleges including Kathmandu Medical College , Nepal Medical College , KIST Medical College , Nepal Army Institute of Health Sciences , National Academy of Medical Sciences ( NAMS ) and Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences ( KUSMS ) , are also located in or around Kathmandu .
He assumed duties again at Camp Meade , Maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . His schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton , Sereno E. Brett , and other senior tank leaders . Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
Historically , the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient Armenia . The earliest attestations of the exonym Armenia date around the 6th century BC . In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC , Darius I the Great of Persia refers to Urashtu ( in Babylonian ) as Armina ( in Old Persian ; Armina ( ) and Harminuya ( in Elamite ) . In Greek , Αρμένιοι " Armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus ( 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians .
In November 1942 , he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations ( NATOUSA ) through the new operational Headquarters Allied ( Expeditionary ) Force Headquarters ( A ( E ) FHQ ) . The word " expeditionary " was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons . The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned underground within the Rock of Gibraltar . Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years .
In the high Renaissance , in fact , there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity , including the writings of the Church fathers , the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels , and in some cases even the Jewish Kabbalah , would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement . With this end in view , Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought . One humanist , the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho ( 1355–1452 ) , based in Mystras , Greece ( but in contact with humanists in Florence , Venice , and Rome ) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism .
Devise Minority Party Strategies . The minority leader , in consultation with other party colleagues , has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives . The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances , such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party . For instance , a majority party riven by internal dissension , as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and " regular " Republicans were at loggerheads , may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion . Among the variable strategies available to the minority party , which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process , are the following :
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of Romanitas . Rome 's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities , including their traditional gods , the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the diis deabusque omnibus ( all the gods and goddesses ) . They also brought Roman " domestic " deities and cult practices with them . By the same token , the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military .
The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world . In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state , while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay . In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town , while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world , and may provide university accommodation for their students .
The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower 's resignation in December 1950 , when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe . Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31 , 1952 , and he resumed his presidency of Columbia . He held this position until January 20 , 1953 , when he became the President of the United States .
The major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in Brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . Industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8 % , Services 28.7 % , Industry 10.2 % , Commerce 6.1 % , Agribusiness 0.2 % .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .

Rome had no separate priestly caste or class . The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices , officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes . Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation . In household cult , the paterfamilias functioned as priest , and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants . Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise . The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines ( the singular is flamen ) , attributed to king Numa : the major flamines , dedicated to Jupiter , Mars and Quirinus , were traditionally drawn from patrician families . Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity , whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some . Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity ; Jupiter 's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career .
There are very few existing mosaics from the Komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in Constantinople is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor John II and Empress Eirene with the Theotokos ( 1122–34 ) . The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name , Piroska shows . The adjacent portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos on a pier ( from 1122 ) is similarly personal . The imperial mausoleum of the Komnenos dynasty , the Pantokrator Monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed . The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent . There is only a " Communion of the Apostles " in the apse of the cathedral of Serres .
Punjab has the largest economy in Pakistan , contributing most to the national GDP . The province 's economy has quadrupled since 1972 . Its share of Pakistan 's GDP was 54.7 % in 2000 and 59 % as of 2010 . It is especially dominant in the service and agriculture sectors of Pakistan 's economy . With its contribution ranging from 52.1 % to 64.5 % in the Service Sector and 56.1 % to 61.5 % in the agriculture sector . It is also major manpower contributor because it has largest pool of professionals and highly skilled ( technically trained ) manpower in Pakistan . It is also dominant in the manufacturing sector , though the dominance is not as huge , with historical contributions raging from a low of 44 % to a high of 52.6 % . In 2007 , Punjab achieved a growth rate of 7.8 % and during the period 2002–03 to 2007–08 , its economy grew at a rate of between 7 % to 8 % per year . and during 2008–09 grew at 6 % against the total GDP growth of Pakistan at 4 % .
The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma . The period was a time of great tectonic activity , as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together . The continent Euramerica ( or Laurussia ) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica , which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn . In these near-deserts , the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed , made red by the oxidized iron ( hematite ) characteristic of drought conditions . Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe , further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia . The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana . The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere . Sea levels were high worldwide , and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas . The deep , enormous Panthalassa ( the " universal ocean " ) covered the rest of the planet . Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys , Proto-Tethys , Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean ( which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica ) .
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection . Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection . There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body . Some viruses once acquired never leave the body . A typical example is the herpes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
IMF 's forecast said that Greece 's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014 . But in fact , the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployemnt . The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009 , and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013 . In 2015 , Greece 's jobless rate is around 24 per cent . It is thought that Greece 's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
In the later Imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped . Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica . The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; St Augustine ( following St Ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567 . Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ—as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway , 12-696 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings , which are allowed , must allow various faiths to lead prayer , or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian . On May 5 , 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings , but also for sectarian prayers like predominately Christian prayers .
Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions , many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx . The New York City Department of Education manages public noncharter schools in the borough . In 2000 , public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx 's residents over 3 years old ( out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools ) . There are also several public charter schools . Private schools range from élite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
The ad fontes principle also had many applications . The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism , and Neoplatonism , whose Pagan wisdom the humanists , like the Church fathers of old , tended , at least initially , to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue . The line from a drama of Terence , Homo sum , humani nihil a me alienum puto ( or with nil for nihil ) , meaning " I am a human being , I think nothing human alien to me " , known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine , gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude . The statement , in a play modeled or borrowed from a ( now lost ) Greek comedy by Menander , may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man 's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning , by Cicero and Saint Augustine , to name a few , and most notably by Seneca . Richard Bauman writes :
Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of Internet use , with the gap closing rapidly in recent years . The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , from 23 % to 56 % respectively ( compared with an EU average of 49 % and 79 % ) . At the same time , there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection , from 4 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2013 ( compared with an EU average of 30 % and 76 % ) . However , Greece also has the EU 's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet : 36 % in 2013 , down from 65 % in 2006 ( compared with an EU average of 21 % and 42 % ) .
Jefferson 's concept of " separation of church and state " first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S. , 98 U.S. 145 ( 1878 ) . In that case , the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US , determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom , " The word 'religion ' is not defined in the Constitution . We must go elsewhere , therefore , to ascertain its meaning , and nowhere more appropriately , we think , than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted . " The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . Quoting the " separation " paragraph from Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , the court concluded that , " coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure , it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . "
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
The major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in Brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . Industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8 % , Services 28.7 % , Industry 10.2 % , Commerce 6.1 % , Agribusiness 0.2 % .
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes . There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome . During the Roman Republic ( 509–27 BC ) , the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs . Priests married , raised families , and led politically active lives . Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul . The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order , thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny . The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods , especially Jupiter , who embodied just rule . As a result of the Punic Wars ( 264–146 BC ) , when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power , many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
In 2010 Piraeus handled 513,319 TEUs , followed by Thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 TEUs . In the same year , 83.9 million people passed through Greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of Paloukia in Salamis , another 12.7 through the port of Perama , 9.5 million through Piraeus and 2.7 million through Igoumenitsa . In 2013 , Piraeus handled a record 3.16 million TEUs , the third-largest figure in the Mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through Pier II , owned by COSCO and 644,000 were transported through Pier I , owned by the Greek state .
In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation , the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough . Radical Reformer , Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt , for example , referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the " new papists " . Since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes . A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut , although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
Although the Reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . Since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most Protestant churches .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
When the U.S. entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth , Kansas . In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers . His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps , where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army . He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command – at the site of " Pickett 's Charge " on the Gettysburg , Pennsylvania Civil War battleground . Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat , he displayed excellent organizational skills , as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers ' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel .
The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings . Unpredictable weather is expected , given that temperatures can drop to 1 °C ( 34 °F ) or less during the winter . During a 2013 cold front , the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to −4 °C ( 25 °F ) , and the lowest temperature was recorded on January 10 , 2013 , at −9.2 °C ( 15.4 °F ) . Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based ( about 65 % of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August ) , and decreases substantially ( 100 to 200 cm ( 39 to 79 in ) ) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal . Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres ( 55.1 in ) for the Kathmandu valley , and averages 1,407 millimetres ( 55.4 in ) for the city of Kathmandu . On average humidity is 75 % . The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards & Meteorology , " Weather Meteorology " for 2005 . The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month . The annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres ( 44.3 in ) for 2005 , as per monthly data included in the table above . The decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu . This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon . [ citation needed ] For example , 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu , totalling over 2,900 mm ( 114 in ) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season . In contrast , 2001 recorded only 356 mm ( 14 in ) of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season .
The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day . By the end of the Mesozoic era , the continents had rifted into nearly their present form . Laurasia became North America and Eurasia , while Gondwana split into South America , Africa , Australia , Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent , which collided with the Asian plate . This impact gave rise to the Himalayas . The Tethys Sea , which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India , began to close up , forming the Mediterranean sea .
From the 9th to 11th century , Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of Lake Van , this included both traditional styles and new innovations . Ornately carved Armenian Khachkars were developed during this time . Many new cities and churches were built during this time , including a new capital at Lake Van and a new Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match . The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty . It was during this time that the first major monasteries , such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were built . This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion .
Episcopalians and Presbyterians , as well as other WASPs , tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated ( having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita ) than most other religious groups in United States , and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business , law and politics , especially the Republican Party . Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors , Rockefeller , Du Pont , Roosevelt , Forbes , Whitneys , the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families .
The " religious test " clause has been interpreted to cover both elected officials and appointed ones , career civil servants as well as political appointees . Religious beliefs or the lack of them have therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution . Seven states , however , have language included in their Bill of Rights , Declaration of Rights , or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs , though some of these have been successfully challenged in court . These states are Texas , Massachusetts , Maryland , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Tennessee .
In May 1955 , McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel . Eisenhower was furious , and issued an order as follows : " It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters ... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications , or any documents or reproductions , concerning such advice be disclosed . " This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting , and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege . Ike 's denial of McCarthy 's access to his staff reduced McCarthy 's hearings to rants about trivial matters , and contributed to his ultimate downfall .
East of the Bronx River , the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas , or 'necks , ' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh : Hunts Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck ( Castle Hill Point ) and Throgs Neck . The East Bronx has older tenement buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multifamily homes , as well as single family homes . It includes New York City 's largest park : Pelham Bay Park along the Westchester-Bronx border .
Starting in the 1970s , the Bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " The Bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film . The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series , when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers . Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire . As the fire was captured on live television , announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " There it is , ladies and gentlemen : the Bronx is burning " . Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
The name Anabaptist , meaning " one who baptizes again " , was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants . Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants . The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist , claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void , the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism . As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues , Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics . [ aa ] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount , which precluded taking oaths , participating in military actions , and participating in civil government , some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise . [ ab ] They were thus technically Anabaptists , even though conservative Amish , Mennonites , and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism . Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front . Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden , Thomas Müntzer , Kaspar Schwenkfeld , Sebastian Franck , Menno Simons . Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck , Conrad Grebel , Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz .
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
After a visit to Brasília , the French writer Simone de Beauvoir complained that all of its superquadras exuded " the same air of elegant monotony , " and other observers have equated the city 's large open lawns , plazas , and fields to wastelands . As the city has matured , some of these have gained adornments , and many have been improved by landscaping , giving some observers a sense of " humanized " spaciousness . Although not fully accomplished , the " Brasília utopia " has produced a city of relatively high quality of life , in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure ( the superquadras ) flanked by small commercial areas , bookstores and cafes ; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit .
On December 20 , 2005 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed , because the purpose of the display ( educating the public on American legal traditions ) was secular in nature . In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3 , 2006 , however , a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed .
Episcopalians and Presbyterians , as well as other WASPs , tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated ( having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita ) than most other religious groups in United States , and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business , law and politics , especially the Republican Party .

In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
The Bronx Museum of the Arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx . Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from Africa , Asia and Latin America , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .

Davies identifies Paine 's The Age of Reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical , historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach . " The first is political , largely French in inspiration , and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty ' . The second is philosophical , German , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . Homo homini deus est ( " The human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , Feuerbach had written .
After 1517 , when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available , the Dutch humanist Erasmus , who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius , began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla , comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter . Erasmus , along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples , began issuing new translations , laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Henceforth Renaissance humanism , particularly in the German North , became concerned with religion , while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists , studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith . After the Reformation , critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school .
In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .
In the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times , notably in 139 BC and 33 BC . In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " Egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19 . Despite several Imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . In the late 1st century AD , Tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at Rome " .
As a consequence of his heart attack , Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm , which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25 , 1957 . This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand . The stroke had caused an aphasia . The president also suffered from Crohn 's disease , chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine , which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9 , 1956 . To treat the intestinal block , surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine . His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis . Eisenhower 's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits , but he still indulged in alcohol . During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29 , 1959 ; however , before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower " drank several gin-and-tonics , and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner " .
Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice ( mainly from the 17th–19th centuries , but the oldest one from 1270–75 , " The burial of St Mark in the first basilica " ) , the Cathedral of Orvieto ( golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century , many times redone ) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca ( huge , striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below , designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century ) . The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the Blessing Christ ( signed by one Solsternus from 1207 ) .
The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make , promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods . Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus ; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson , all bearing the same name , also devoted themselves . Before the battle , Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate . When he offers sacrifice , the victim 's liver appears " damaged where it refers to his own fortunes " . Otherwise , the haruspex tells him , the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods . In a prayer recorded by Livy , Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus , charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks , and is killed ; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering . Had he failed to die , his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void , with possibly disastrous consequences . The act of devotio is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator .
Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion . Most important was " the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life , " which sought to confine religion to a private sphere . Further , the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants ( and most Jews ) , who opposed aid to religious schools , which were mostly Catholic at the time . After 1980 , however , anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants , and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed . While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state , much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position . As a consequence , strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths , even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics . [ citation needed ]
The agglomeration of Kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . The urban area of the Kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . They have the three highest population densities in the country . Within the districts lie VDCs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( Bhaktapur , Kirtipur , Madhyapur Thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( Lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( Kathmandu ) . Some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , Gonggabu VDC notably recorded a density over 20,000 people/km2 . ( 2011 census ) . The following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
Jefferson 's concept of " separation of church and state " first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S. , 98 U.S. 145 ( 1878 ) . In that case , the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US , determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom , " The word 'religion ' is not defined in the Constitution . We must go elsewhere , therefore , to ascertain its meaning , and nowhere more appropriately , we think , than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted . " The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . Quoting the " separation " paragraph from Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , the court concluded that , " coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure , it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . "
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower 's combat command skills ; during the initial phase of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's move into the Kasserine Pass , Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates . He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall , commanding U.S. II Corps . He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns . In February 1943 , his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery . The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign . Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA .
The City of New York has an official television station run by the NYC Media Group and broadcasting from Bronx Community College , and Cablevision operates News 12 The Bronx , both of which feature programming based in the Bronx . Co-op City was the first area in the Bronx , and the first in New York beyond Manhattan , to have its own cable television provider . The local public-access television station BronxNet originates from Herbert H. Lehman College , the borough 's only four year CUNY school , and provides government-access television ( GATV ) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents .
Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of " separation of church and state " , or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment . Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution , while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified . These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers . Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts , and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence , which references the idea of a " Creator " and " Nature 's God " , though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a " Creator " or " Nature 's God . "
Jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1879 ) the Court wrote that Jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ First ] Amendment . " In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , Justice Hugo Black wrote : " In the words of Thomas Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state . "
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
In May 2014 , prior to the launch of YouTube 's subscription-based Music Key service , the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were " undervalued " in comparison to other streaming services , and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014 , Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " Stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . However , YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal .
In November 1956 , Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British , French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis , receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt . Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
In 1962 , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of officially-sponsored prayer or religious recitations in public schools . In Engel v. Vitale , 370 U.S. 421 ( 1962 ) , the Court , by a vote of 6-1 , determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools , even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation . ( The prayer required by the New York State Board of Regents prior to the Court 's decision consisted of : " Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee , and we beg Thy blessings upon us , our parents , our teachers , and our country . Amen . " ) As the Court stated :
The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma . During the early Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana ; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow , while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana itself rifted apart . The Tethys Sea closed , and the Neotethys basin appeared . Climates were warm , with no evidence of glaciation . As in the Triassic , there was apparently no land near either pole , and no extensive ice caps existed . The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe , where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas ; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen . In contrast , the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic , with few outcrops at the surface . Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic , most exposed sediments from this period are continental , such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation . The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic , marking the Nevadan orogeny . Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia , India , South America , Japan , Australasia and the United Kingdom .
Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . A cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells . The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well . Two methods , the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease . The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria , both of which contain many significant human pathogens . The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America . The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement , Nicolaus Zinzendorf , the Moravian Church , Lutheran pietism , Presbyterianism and Puritanism . Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Harold John Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones .
The Bronx 's evolution from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop was the subject of an award-winning documentary , produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS in 2006 , " From Mambo to Hip Hop : A South Bronx Tale " . Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s . The New York Times has identified 1520 Sedgwick Avenue " an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway " as a starting point , where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community room .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith ( see Christian Humanism ) . They inveighed against the abuses of the Church , but not against the Church itself , much less against religion . For them , the word " secular " carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later , in the nineteenth century . In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery . Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo 's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own ( although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life ) . He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue , inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer . By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base , however , the methods of the humanists , combined with their eloquence , would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers . According to Gopalraj Vansawali , a genealogy of Nepali monarchs , the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas , Mahispalas , Aabhirs , Kirants , and Somavanshi . The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber . During the Kirata era , a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu . In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages , Kathmandu is still called Yambu . Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu , near Manjupattan . During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler , Jitedasti , Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu .
The ad fontes principle also had many applications . The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism , and Neoplatonism , whose Pagan wisdom the humanists , like the Church fathers of old , tended , at least initially , to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue . The line from a drama of Terence , Homo sum , humani nihil a me alienum puto ( or with nil for nihil ) , meaning " I am a human being , I think nothing human alien to me " , known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine , gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude . The statement , in a play modeled or borrowed from a ( now lost ) Greek comedy by Menander , may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man 's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning , by Cicero and Saint Augustine , to name a few , and most notably by Seneca . Richard Bauman writes :
At the time , there were many varying opinions about Christian doctrine , and no centralized way of enforcing orthodoxy . Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting , and some 318 bishops ( very few from the Western Empire ) attended the First Council of Nicaea . The purpose of this meeting was to define Christian orthodoxy and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies . The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed and other statements . Later , Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine . Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties .
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian 's reign . The figures , animals , plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background . The portrait of a moustached man , probably a Gothic chieftain , is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age . The so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II 's reign around 565–577 . Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room . The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition . There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki ( 5th–6th centuries ) .
Protestants reject the Roman Catholic Church 's doctrine that it is the one true church , believing in the invisible church , which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ . Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations , and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others . Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences . Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs . Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith , non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . From that point on , Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution . During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century , “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms” , regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State , and therefore threatened its existence . The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism ; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework . Christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . A cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells .

Punjab is Pakistan 's second largest province in terms of land area at 205,344 km2 ( 79,284 sq mi ) , after Balochistan , and is located at the north western edge of the geologic Indian plate in South Asia . The province is bordered by Kashmir ( Azad Kashmir , Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir , India ) to the northeast , the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east , the Pakistani province of Sindh to the south , the province of Balochistan to the southwest , the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the north .
The development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between New England and New York ( Manhattan ) . Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule . Kingsbridge , built in 1693 where Broadway reached the Spuyten Duyvil Creek , was a possession of Frederick Philipse , lord of Philipse Manor . The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek . In 1759 , the farmers led by Jacobus Dyckman and Benjamin Palmer built a " free bridge " across the Harlem River which led to the abandonment of tolls altogether .
In the later Imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped . Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica . The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; St Augustine ( following St Ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567 . Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .
Between 1949 and the 1980s , telephone communications in Greece were a state monopoly by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization , better known by its acronym , OTE . Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s , OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe . Since 2011 , the company 's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40 % stake , while the Greek state continues to own 10 % of the company 's shares . OTE owns several subsidiaries across the Balkans , including Cosmote , Greece 's top mobile telecommunications provider , Cosmote Romania and Albanian Mobile Communications .
In 1948 , Eisenhower became President of Columbia University , an Ivy League university in New York City . The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction . During that year Eisenhower 's memoir , Crusade in Europe , was published . Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs , and it was a major financial success as well . Eisenhower 's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer , but rather , marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences , and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $ 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate . This ruling saved Eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map , made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba , Jordan . It was rediscovered in 1894 . The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land . It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south , and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert . The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem , at the center of the map . The map is enriched with many naturalistic features , like animals , fishing boats , bridges and palm trees
Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings , a far more prestigious artform , and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos . Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek , suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire ; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves . Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa , in places such as Carthage , and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis , Tunisia .
Believers in Pashupatinath ( mainly Hindus ) are allowed to enter the temple premises , but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River . The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka , South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla . This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam ( Unified India ) by encouraging cultural exchange . This procedure is followed in other temples around India , which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya .
In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war . Believing that a general should not participate in politics , one author later wrote that " figuratively speaking , [ Eisenhower ] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office " . As others asked him about his political future , Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job " from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe " , and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions . In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired , the president would help the general win the 1948 election , and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower 's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination .
The rediscovery of Aristotle 's works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated –fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history . Richard Dales , for instance , calls the discovery of Aristotle 's works " a turning point in the history of Western thought . " After Aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in Latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . The efforts of this " scholasticism " were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason . This became the primary mission of lecturers , and the expectation of students .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages . The objective is to start a regular " Bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " Field Service Report " . Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive " .
Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science ( see the history of science in the Renaissance ) . This was despite what A. C. Crombie ( viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress ) calls " a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity " , in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world . But Renaissance humanists , who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity , had no interest in scientific innovation . However , by the mid-to-late 16th century , even the universities , though still dominated by Scholasticism , began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology , thus setting the stage for Galileo 's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism .
Kumari Ghar is a palace in the center of the Kathmandu city , next to the Durbar square where a Royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides . Kumari , or Kumari Devi , is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in South Asian countries . In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous . Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju ( the Nepali name for Durga ) until she menstruates , after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body . Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status . The current Royal Kumari , Matina Shakya , age four , was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy .

The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Traditionally , the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the House , with the Majority Leader as second-in-command . For instance , when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections , Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader . Despite this , Cantor and his successor , Kevin McCarthy , have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House , since Boehner is still reckoned as the leader of the House Republicans . However , there have been some exceptions . The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006 . In contrast , the Minority Leader is the undisputed leader of the minority party .
Chthonic gods such as Dis pater , the di inferi ( " gods below " ) , and the collective shades of the departed ( di Manes ) were given dark , fertile victims in nighttime rituals . Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering , and there was no shared banquet , as " the living can not share a meal with the dead " . Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals ; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival . Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices . Demigods and heroes , who belonged to the heavens and the underworld , were sometimes given black-and-white victims . Robigo ( or Robigus ) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas , garnering little criticism , though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment . The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation . Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology ( the doctrine of how the church as a body works ) , they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers , compared to the Catholics ' idea that certain people within the church , or ideas that were old enough , had a special status in giving understanding of the text .

With the abatement of persecution , St. Jerome acknowledged the Empire as a bulwark against evil but insisted that " imperial honours " were contrary to Christian teaching . His was an authoritative but minority voice : most Christians showed no qualms in the veneration of even " pagan " emperors . The peace of the emperors was the peace of God ; as far as the Church was concerned , internal dissent and doctrinal schism were a far greater problem . The solution came from a hitherto unlikely source : as pontifex maximus Constantine I favoured the " Catholic Church of the Christians " against the Donatists because :
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
The official published membership statistics , such as those mentioned above , include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry ; official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings . As a result , only about half of those who self-identified as Jehovah 's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself . The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion : about 37 % of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah 's Witnesses .
The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime-free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
In contrast , the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions . To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law , some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts can not be obtained in time , and where , without interference of the police , the realization of the private right would be impeded . This would , for example , allow police to establish a restaurant guest 's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest can not pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table .
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
The last three years of Eisenhower 's second term in office were ones of relatively good health . Eventually after leaving the White House , he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks . A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs . In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis , for which he underwent surgery on December 12 , 1966 , when his gallbladder was removed , containing 16 gallstones . After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 ( see below ) , an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma , a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease . Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
On July 26 , 1931 , at a convention in Columbus , Ohio , Rutherford introduced the new name—Jehovah 's witnesses—based on Isaiah 43:10 : " Ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , and my servant whom I have chosen " —which was adopted by resolution . The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society , as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods . In 1932 , Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 , introduced what he called a " theocratic " ( literally , God-ruled ) organizational system , under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters .
Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests . While not always an efficient form of pest control , varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated . Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops , livestock , landscaping , infrastructure , and pets . Some animals , such as wild rabbits or squirrels , may be utilised for fur or meat , but often no use is made of the carcass . Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area . Common varmints may include various rodents , coyotes , crows , foxes , feral cats , and feral hogs . Some animals once considered varmints are now protected , such as wolves . In the US state of Louisiana , a non-native rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population .
Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences . Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . Concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . While YouTube 's revenue-sharing " Partner Program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels " . In 2013 Forbes ' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media . In 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega " , " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo . By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts .
Democracy , social-contract theory , separation of powers , religious freedom , separation of church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers . Some of the philosophers of the English , Scottish , German , and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , John Toland , David Hume , Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , Christian Wolff , Immanuel Kant , and Jean-Jacques Rousseau - had Protestant backgrounds . For example , John Locke , whose political thought was based on " a set of Protestant Christian assumptions " , derived the equality of all humans , including the equality of the genders ( " Adam and Eve " ) , from Genesis 1 , 26-28 . As all persons were created equally free , all governments needed " the consent of the governed . " These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence , which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation : " We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . "
The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support some church , but this was more often Dutch Reformed , Quaker or Presbyterian , than Anglican . Some chose to support more than one church . He also ordained that the tax-payers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the Duke , as an openly divine-right Catholic , was no friend of Anglicanism . The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698 , though Anglicanism was more popular in New York .

The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County , one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York . The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers , Eastchester , and Pelham . In 1846 , a new town , West Farms , was created by division of Westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of Morrisania was created from West Farms . In 1873 , the town of Kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge , Riverdale , and Woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of Yonkers .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
In 1899 , the memorial , by the Berlin sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter ( 1846–1917 ) , finally came to rest , although subject to repeated vandalism , in the Bronx , at 164th Street and the Grand Concourse , or Joyce Kilmer Park near today 's Yankee Stadium . ( In 1999 , it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse . ) In 2007 , Christopher Gray of The New York Times described it as " a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei , the mythical German figure , surrounded by mermaids , dolphins and seashells . "

This ruling saved Eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
Like the Speaker of the House , the Minority Leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position . When Nancy Pelosi , D-CA , became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress , she had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress . When her predecessor , Richard Gephardt , D-MO , became minority leader in the 104th House , he had been in the House for almost 20 years , had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years , had been a 1988 presidential candidate , and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections . Gephardt 's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel , R-IL , who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House . Michel 's predecessor , Republican John Rhodes of Arizona , was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community . Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta 's flame . The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home . Besides their own festival of Vestalia , they participated directly in the rites of Parilia , Parentalia and Fordicidia . Indirectly , they played a role in every official sacrifice ; among their duties was the preparation of the mola salsa , the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation .
In the 1970s , the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson . The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities , like the South Bronx . The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area . The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment , which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx .
Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later Middle Ages and the Early Modern period . The 19th-century German historian Georg Voigt ( 1827–91 ) identified Petrarch as the first Renaissance humanist . Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was " the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness " . According to Petrarch , what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors . For Petrarch and Boccaccio , the greatest master was Cicero , whose prose became the model for both learned ( Latin ) and vernacular ( Italian ) prose .
The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers , and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system . Their job was apolitical ; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law . This was very different to the 'Continental model ' of the police force that had been developed in France , where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state .
The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make , promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods . Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus ; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson , all bearing the same name , also devoted themselves . Before the battle , Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate . When he offers sacrifice , the victim 's liver appears " damaged where it refers to his own fortunes " . Otherwise , the haruspex tells him , the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods . In a prayer recorded by Livy , Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus , charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks , and is killed ; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering . Had he failed to die , his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void , with possibly disastrous consequences . The act of devotio is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator .
In 1758 , the general of the Hindu Maratha Empire , Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Attock . Timur Shah Durrani , the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali , was driven out of Punjab . Lahore , Multan , Dera Ghazi Khan , Kashmir and other subahs on the south and eastern side of Peshawar were under the Maratha rule for the most part . In Punjab and Kashmir , the Marathas were now major players . The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 1761 , Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded the Maratha territory of Punjab and captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and re-consolidated control over them .
Punjab 's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan , the Jhelum , Chenab , Ravi , and Sutlej rivers . There are several mountainous regions , including the Sulaiman Mountains in the southwest part of the province , and Margalla Hills , Salt Range , and Pothohar Plateau in the north . Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment in Punjab ; wheat and cotton are the principal crops . Since independence , Punjab has become the seat of political and economic power ; it remains the most industrialised province of Pakistan . It counts for 39.2 % of large scale manufacturing and 70 % of small scale manufacturing in the country . Its capital Lahore is a major regional cultural , historical , and economic centre .
During the Early Modern period ( approximately late 15th century to 1800 ) , the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth , productivity and innovative research . At the end of the Middle Ages , about 400 years after the first university was founded , there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe . In the 15th century , twenty-eight new ones were created , with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625 . This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe , with the highest concentrations in the German Empire ( 34 ) , Italian countries ( 26 ) , France ( 25 ) , and Spain ( 23 ) – this was close to a 500 % increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages . This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared , or institutions that merged with other universities during this time . It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period , as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions . In fact , the term " university " was not always used to designate a higher education institution . In Mediterranean countries , the term studium generale was still often used , while " Academy " was common in Northern European countries .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
Until the 1980s , the governor of the Federal District was appointed by the Federal Government , and the laws of Brasília were issued by the Brazilian Federal Senate . With the Constitution of 1988 Brasília gained the right to elect its Governor , and a District Assembly ( Câmara Legislativa ) was elected to exercise legislative power . The Federal District does not have a Judicial Power of its own . The Judicial Power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories . Currently , Brazil does not have any territories , therefore , for now the courts serve only cases from the Federal District .
Among the vast varieties of microorganisms , relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals . Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect . The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen , depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen . However a host 's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection . Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens :
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures ; in principle , Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin , Etruscan and other Italian peoples , cults and deities as Roman . Those who acknowledged Rome 's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars , independent of Roman religious law . Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis . Autonomy and concord were official policy , but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models . Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages , especially to local elites . All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia . By the middle of the 1st century AD , Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established , Romanised cult nearby : by the end of that century , Sabratha’s so-called tophet was no longer in use . Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome 's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice , not a centralised legal requirement . Major cult centres to " non-Roman " deities continued to prosper : notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium , the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo 's sacred wood at Antioch .
South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to South America 's distinctive marsupial faunas . The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean . Africa 's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea , cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean . Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia . Near the end of the Pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the Quaternary Period ) , the current ice age began . The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented . After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium , in a stone chamber " which had on a previous occasion [ 228 BC ] also been polluted by human victims , a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings " . Livy avoids the word " sacrifice " in connection with this bloodless human life-offering ; Plutarch does not . The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC , preparatory to an invasion of Gaul . Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain .
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
In the high Renaissance , in fact , there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity , including the writings of the Church fathers , the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels , and in some cases even the Jewish Kabbalah , would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement . With this end in view , Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought . One humanist , the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho ( 1355–1452 ) , based in Mystras , Greece ( but in contact with humanists in Florence , Venice , and Rome ) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism .
In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation , Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion . These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom . In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Latvia , Estonia and Hungary , it remains one of the most popular religions . Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements , there are only few Protestant adherents ; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs , restrictions during the Communist rule , and also the ongoing secularization . Over the last several decades , religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased . According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer , Protestants made up 12 % of the EU population . According to Pew Research Center , Protestants constituted nearly one fifth ( or 17.8 % ) of the continent 's Christian population in 2010 . Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15 % of all Europeans in 2009 , while Noll claims that less than 12 % of them lived in Europe in 2010 .
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier . Traditionally , these festivals were celebrated by Newars . In recent years , these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well . As the capital of the Republic of Nepal , various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu . With mass migration to the city , the cultures of Khas from the west , Kirats from the east , Bon/Tibetan from the north , and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously . The festivities such as the Ghode ( horse ) Jatra , Indra Jatra , Dashain Durga Puja festivals , Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm . Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics . These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings , as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion .
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
Multiracial Americans are also a sizable minority in the Bronx . People of multiracial heritage number over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and African American heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2 % of the population . People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1 % of the population . People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1 % of the population .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
Instruments like the duduk , the dhol , the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music . Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music . One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia . Many of these chants are ancient in origin , extending to pre-Christian times , while others are relatively modern , including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots , the inventor of the Armenian alphabet . Whilst under Soviet rule , Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music , for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article , " Preventive police " in the London Review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . The reason , argued Chadwick , was that " A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation . " In contrast to a deterrent of punishment , a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - " crime does n't pay " . In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act , the " object " of the new Metropolitan Police , was changed by Robert Peel to the " principal object , " which was the " prevention of crime . " Later historians would attribute the perception of England 's " appearance of orderliness and love of public order " to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel 's police system .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower 's combat command skills ; during the initial phase of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's move into the Kasserine Pass , Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates . He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall , commanding U.S. II Corps . He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns . In February 1943 , his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery . The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign . Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
Kathmandu valley is described as " an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures " , which are made of wood , stone , metal , and terracotta , and found in profusion in temples , shrines , stupas , gompas , chaityasm and palaces . The art objects are also seen in street corners , lanes , private courtyards and in open ground . Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses . Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time , but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950 .
Jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1879 ) the Court wrote that Jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ First ] Amendment . " In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , Justice Hugo Black wrote : " In the words of Thomas Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state . "
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .
Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays . Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal , which can be detected by some form of instrumentation . Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen . To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases , immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent . For example , immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle . Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism 's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus .
The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva ( Pashupati ) . Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu , Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu . It served as the seat of national deity , Lord Pashupatinath , until Nepal was secularized . However , a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior . The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century , although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old . The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Shivaratri , or the night of Lord Shiva , is the most important festival that takes place here , attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus .

Maharaja Ranjit Singh 's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state . Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down , starting the First Anglo-Sikh War ; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to British India . After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 , the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India . In Jhelum 35 British soldiers of HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . [ citation needed ]
In the immediate years after Eisenhower left office , his reputation declined . He was widely seen by critics as an inactive , uninspiring , golf-playing president compared to his vigorous young successor . Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock , Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted . Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment , for the Soviet Union 's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race , and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism .
Kathmandu is dissected by eight rivers , the main river of the valley , the Bagmati and its tributaries , of which the Bishnumati , Dhobi Khola , Manohara Khola , Hanumant Khola , and Tukucha Khola are predominant . The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the elevation range of 1,500–3,000 metres ( 4,900–9,800 ft ) , and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley . An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu ; this canal is now extinct .
Democracy , social-contract theory , separation of powers , religious freedom , separation of church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers . Some of the philosophers of the English , Scottish , German , and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , John Toland , David Hume , Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , Christian Wolff , Immanuel Kant , and Jean-Jacques Rousseau - had Protestant backgrounds . For example , John Locke , whose political thought was based on " a set of Protestant Christian assumptions " , derived the equality of all humans , including the equality of the genders ( " Adam and Eve " ) , from Genesis 1 , 26-28 . As all persons were created equally free , all governments needed " the consent of the governed . " These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence , which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation : " We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . "
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington , where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany . He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division ( WPD ) , General Leonard T. Gerow , and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division . Next , he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division ( which replaced WPD ) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]

Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
The city 's planned design included specific areas for almost everything , including accommodation , Hotels Sectors North and South . New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere , such as the hotels and tourism Sector North , located on the shores of Lake Paranoá . Brasília has a range of tourist accommodation from inns , pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels . The city 's restaurants cater to a wide range of foods from local and regional Brazilian dishes to international cuisine .
After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . From that point on , Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution . During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century , “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms” , regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State , and therefore threatened its existence . The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism ; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework . Christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
A central teaching of Jehovah 's Witnesses is that the current world era , or " system of things " , entered the " last days " in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ , leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably . They consider all other present-day religions to be false , identifying them with " Babylon the Great " , or the " harlot " , of Revelation 17 , and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations , which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17 . This development will mark the beginning of the " great tribulation " . Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah 's Witnesses , an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon , during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ 's " sheep " , or true followers , will be destroyed . After Armageddon , God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth , which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden . After Armageddon , most of those who had died before God 's intervention will gradually be resurrected during " judgment day " lasting for one thousand years . This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds . At the end of the thousand years , Christ will hand all authority back to God . Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind . Those who fail will be destroyed , along with Satan and his demons . The end result will be a fully tested , glorified human race .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine , mathematics , astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution . Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university , the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution . Historians such as Richard S. Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists . This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors , usually in princely courts , and associations with newly forming scientific societies .
Sociologist Rodney Stark states that Jehovah 's Witness leaders are " not always very democratic " and that members " are expected to conform to rather strict standards , " but adds that " enforcement tends to be very informal , sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group " , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as " part of the power structure rather than subject to it . " Sociologist Andrew Holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah 's Witnesses have made an informed choice . However , he also states that defectors " are seldom allowed a dignified exit " , and describes the administration as autocratic .
In the 2005 OECD report for Greece , it was clearly stated that " the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece 's ] EMU membership qualification " . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece 's application , and thus the criteria had been met .
Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials . They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas , once common in the Eastern Mediterranean . The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham 's Palace , Palestine which was made around 744 . The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer ( right side ) and two deers peacefully grazing ( left side ) . The panel probably represents good and bad governance . Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar , Lebanon . The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat ( in present-day Jordan ) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill . The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by " good " animals on one side and " bad " animals on the other . Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls , grapes , pomegranates , oryx , wolves , hares , a leopard , pairs of partridges , fish , bulls , ostriches , rabbits , rams , goats , lions and a snake . At Qastal , near Amman , excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan , dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ( 685–705 ) . They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor . The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns , trees , animals , fruits and rosettes . Except for the open courtyard , entrance and staircases , the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics .
The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park , which includes Orchard Beach—and the fourth largest , Van Cortlandt Park , which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers . Also in the northern Bronx , Wave Hill , the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house , gardens , changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale . Nearer the borough 's center , and along the Bronx River , is Bronx Park ; its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens , which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire county , and its southern end the Bronx Zoo , the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States . Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir , surrounded by 2 miles ( 3 km ) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood ; the reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack . Further south is Crotona Park , home to a 3.3-acre ( 1.3 ha ) lake , 28 species of trees , and a large swimming pool . The land for these parks , and many others , was bought by New York City in 1888 , while land was still open and inexpensive , in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development .
Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science ( see the history of science in the Renaissance ) . This was despite what A. C. Crombie ( viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress ) calls " a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity " , in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world . But Renaissance humanists , who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity , had no interest in scientific innovation . However , by the mid-to-late 16th century , even the universities , though still dominated by Scholasticism , began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology , thus setting the stage for Galileo 's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively shaped the Church of Scotland . The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines , and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France . John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation . The Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope 's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560 , forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith . It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise , who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter .
Much of YouTube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . In 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . In May 2013 , Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . In February 2015 , Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
In November 1945 , Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army . His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . However , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets , Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon . Indeed , Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese , writing , " First , the Japanese were ready to surrender and it was n't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . Second , I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " Initially , Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets . He even visited Warsaw in 1945 . Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . However , by mid-1947 , as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated , Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
In the 1970s , the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson . The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities , like the South Bronx . The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area . The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment , which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479 , Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood ( Santa Hermandad ) as a national police force . They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves , and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases . The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835 .
The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up , as Europe , Greenland and North America drifted apart . In western North America , mountain building started in the Eocene , and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts . In Europe , the Tethys Sea finally vanished , while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant , the Mediterranean , and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north . Though the North Atlantic was opening , a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia , creating the Himalayan orogeny .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .
In the 2005 OECD report for Greece , it was clearly stated that " the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece 's ] EMU membership qualification " . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece 's application , and thus the criteria had been met .
Eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army 's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy . He was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast . His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System . Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956 .
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece’s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece’s Eurozone entry .
The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century , beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity , and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia . The early churches were mostly simple basilicas , but some with side apses . By the fifth century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used . By the seventh century , centrally planned churches had been built and a more complicated niched buttress and radiating Hrip'simé style had formed . By the time of the Arab invasion , most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed .
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas , allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses . Mosaic murals , benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smoother and more even surface .
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries , including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal . Nepal 's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions , Hinduism and Buddhhism . These are amply reflected in the many temples , shrines , stupas , monasteries , and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur . The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day , including archeological exportation .
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
In the late 1130s , Arnold of Brescia , an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church . After his death , his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists , and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans , though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation . In the early 1170s , Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians . He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church . By 1215 , the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution . Despite that , the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy , as a part of the wider Reformed tradition .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
When the U.S. entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth , Kansas . In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers . His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps , where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army . He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command – at the site of " Pickett 's Charge " on the Gettysburg , Pennsylvania Civil War battleground . Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat , he displayed excellent organizational skills , as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers ' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower 's resignation in December 1950 , when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe . Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31 , 1952 , and he resumed his presidency of Columbia . He held this position until January 20 , 1953 , when he became the President of the United States .
The official published membership statistics , such as those mentioned above , include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry ; official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings . As a result , only about half of those who self-identified as Jehovah 's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself . The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion : about 37 % of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah 's Witnesses .
The Bronx Museum of the Arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx . Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from Africa , Asia and Latin America , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica .
Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that Christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . The national motto " In God We Trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . A circuit court ruling affirmed Ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible , " With God , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
In the 6th century BCE , Taoist teacher Lao Tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . The Silver Rule of Confucianism from Analects XV.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . Humanistic thought is also contained in other Confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in Zuo Zhuan , Ji Liang says , " People is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . So , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; Neishi Guo says , " Gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " Taoist and Confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos , and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface . A small number of videos , such as the weekly addresses by President Barack Obama , can be downloaded as MP4 files . Numerous third-party web sites , applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos . In February 2009 , YouTube announced a test service , allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout . In June 2012 , Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos . In response , Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site . The default settings when uploading a video to YouTube will retain a copyright on the video for the uploader , but since July 2012 it has been possible to select a Creative Commons license as the default , allowing other users to reuse and remix the material if it is free of copyright .
Greece was accused of trying to cover up the extent of its massive budget deficit in the wake of the global financial crisis . The allegation was prompted by the massive revision of the 2009 budget deficit forecast by the new PASOK government elected in October 2009 , from " 6–8 % " ( estimated by the previous New Democracy government ) to 12.7 % ( later revised to 15.7 % ) . However , the accuracy of the revised figures has also been questioned , and in February 2012 the Hellenic Parliament voted in favor of an official investigation following accusations by a former member of the Hellenic Statistical Authority that the deficit had been artificially inflated in order to justify harsher austerity measures .
Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty-five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand-year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid-1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s .
In May 2007 , YouTube launched its Partner Program , a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site . YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program , with 55 percent going to the uploader . There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program . According to TubeMogul , in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube ( one that is shown before the video starts ) cost advertisers on average $ 7.60 per 1000 views . Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement , due to a lack of interested advertisers . Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos , a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $ 7.60 X 55 % = $ 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 .
Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it . They sought to create a citizenry ( frequently including women ) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions . This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis , today known as the humanities : grammar , rhetoric , history , poetry and moral philosophy . As a program to revive the cultural – and particularly the literary – legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity , Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like Rabelais or Erasmus as is still sometimes popularly believed .
There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level . In 1773 , Isaac Backus , a prominent Baptist minister in New England , wrote against a state sanctioned religion , saying : " Now who can hear Christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? " He also observed that when " church and state are separate , the effects are happy , and they do not at all interfere with each other : but where they have been confounded together , no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued . " Thomas Jefferson 's influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786 , five years before the Bill of Rights .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
In Canada , the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was founded in 1729 , making it the first police force in present-day Canada . It was followed in 1834 by the Toronto Police , and in 1838 by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City . A national force , the Dominion Police , was founded in 1868 . Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament , but its responsibilities quickly grew . The famous Royal Northwest Mounted Police was founded in 1873 . The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Since the 19th century , many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or " gatekeeper " , sometimes described as the President 's Private Secretary , sometimes with no official title at all . Eisenhower formalized this role , introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army . Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position . Initially , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff , but each eventually appointed one .
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as : Bhavani , Durga , Gaja-Lakshmi , Hariti-Sitala , Mahsishamardini , Saptamatrika ( seven mother goddesses ) , and Sri-Lakshmi ( wealth-goddess ) . From the 3rd century BC , apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses , Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period ( it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC ) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular . These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution : the Licchavi or classical period ( 500 to 900 AD ) , the post-classical period ( 1000 to 1400 AD ) , with strong influence of the Palla art form ; the Malla period ( 1400 onwards ) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology .
The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens , that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama , Vice President Biden , White House staff , and several cabinet secretaries . Similarly , in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd 's video " My story : Struggling , bullying , suicide , self-harm " , legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy .
Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 . Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan 's nuclear program such as Kahuta . It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi . The peace process between India and Pakistan , which began in earnest in 2004 , has helped pacify the situation . Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common . Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib .
The major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in Brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . Industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8 % , Services 28.7 % , Industry 10.2 % , Commerce 6.1 % , Agribusiness 0.2 % .
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
In the Presidential primary elections of February 5 , 2008 , Sen. Clinton won 61.2 % of the Bronx 's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8 % for Barack Obama and 1.0 % for the other four candidates combined ( John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Bill Richardson and Joe Biden ) . On the same day , John McCain won 54.4 % of the borough 's 5,643 Republican votes , Mitt Romney 20.8 % , Mike Huckabee 8.2 % , Ron Paul 7.4 % , Rudy Giuliani 5.6 % , and the other candidates ( Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes ) 3.6 % between them .
The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park , which includes Orchard Beach—and the fourth largest , Van Cortlandt Park , which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers . Also in the northern Bronx , Wave Hill , the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house , gardens , changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale . Nearer the borough 's center , and along the Bronx River , is Bronx Park ; its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens , which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire county , and its southern end the Bronx Zoo , the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States . Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir , surrounded by 2 miles ( 3 km ) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood ; the reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack . Further south is Crotona Park , home to a 3.3-acre ( 1.3 ha ) lake , 28 species of trees , and a large swimming pool . The land for these parks , and many others , was bought by New York City in 1888 , while land was still open and inexpensive , in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development .
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris , then the largest city in Europe . The royal edict , registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15 , 1667 created the office of lieutenant général de police ( " lieutenant general of police " ) , who was to be the head of the new Paris police force , and defined the task of the police as " ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals , purging the city of what may cause disturbances , procuring abundance , and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties " .
Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science . In fact , more than 80 % of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained , of which approximately 45 % held university posts . It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable , and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development . There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system , which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world . However , university professors still utilized some autonomy , at least in the sciences , to choose epistemological foundations and methods . For instance , Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction . Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . As a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . Also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . As a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
Others , such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . However , the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support some church , but this was more often Dutch Reformed , Quaker or Presbyterian , than Anglican . Some chose to support more than one church . He also ordained that the tax-payers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the Duke , as an openly divine-right Catholic , was no friend of Anglicanism . The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698 , though Anglicanism was more popular in New York .
Like other neighborhoods in New York City , the South Bronx has no official boundaries . The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham Road was often used as a northern limit . The Bronx River more consistently forms an eastern boundary . The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi-unit homes . The South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse , Borough Hall , and other government buildings , as well as Yankee Stadium . The Cross Bronx Expressway bisects it , east to west . The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
A pater familias was the senior priest of his household . He offered daily cult to his lares and penates , and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth . His wife ( mater familias ) was responsible for the household 's cult to Vesta . In rural estates , bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines ( lararia ) and their deities . Household cults had state counterparts . In Vergil 's Aeneid , Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the lares and penates from Troy , along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
The Cathedral of Brasília in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil , is an expression of the architect Oscar Niemeyer . This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure , seems with its glass roof reaching up , open , to the heavens . On 31 May 1970 , the Cathedral’s structure was finished , and only the 70 m ( 229.66 ft ) diameter of the circular area were visible . Niemeyer 's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric . The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns . These columns , having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t , represent two hands moving upwards to heaven . The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970 .
In May 2007 , YouTube launched its Partner Program , a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site . YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program , with 55 percent going to the uploader . There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program . According to TubeMogul , in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube ( one that is shown before the video starts ) cost advertisers on average $ 7.60 per 1000 views . Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement , due to a lack of interested advertisers . Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos , a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $ 7.60 X 55 % = $ 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 .
In brief , there is disagreement among historical analysts as to the exact time period when the minority leadership emerged officially as a party position . Nonetheless , it seems safe to conclude that the position emerged during the latter part of the 19th century , a period of strong party organization and professional politicians . This era was " marked by strong partisan attachments , resilient patronage-based party organizations , and ... high levels of party voting in Congress . " Plainly , these were conditions conducive to the establishment of a more highly differentiated House leadership structure .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) .

The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva ( Pashupati ) . Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu , Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu . It served as the seat of national deity , Lord Pashupatinath , until Nepal was secularized . However , a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior . The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century , although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old . The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Shivaratri , or the night of Lord Shiva , is the most important festival that takes place here , attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus .

After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna . The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century . Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo . The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest . The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549 . The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco , executed in 545–547 ( largely destroyed ; the remains in Berlin ) .
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances . Some rituals specifically required the presence of women , but their active participation was limited . As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice , the central rite of most major public ceremonies . In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals , some cult practices were reserved for women only . The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely . Because women enter the public record less frequently than men , their religious practices are less known , and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias . A host of deities , however , are associated with motherhood . Juno , Diana , Lucina , and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent .
Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors : the Central Sector , the East Sector , the North Sector , the City Core and the West Sector . For civic administration , the city is further divided into 35 administrative wards . The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members . It holds biannual meetings to review , process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions . The ward 's profile documents for the 35 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population , the structure and condition of houses , the type of roads , educational , health and financial institutions , entertainment facilities , parking space , security provisions , etc . It also includes lists of development projects completed , on-going and planned , along with informative data about the cultural heritage , festivals , historical sites and the local inhabitants . Ward 16 is the largest , with an area of 437.4 ha ; ward 26 is the smallest , with an area of 4 ha .
Confer With the White House . If his or her party controls the White House , the minority leader confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress , the Administration 's agenda , and political events generally . Strategically , the role of the minority leader will vary depending on whether the President is of the same party or the other party . In general , minority leaders will often work to advance the goals and aspirations of their party 's President in Congress . When Robert Michel , R-IL , was minority leader ( 1981–1995 ) , he typically functioned as the " point man " for Republican presidents . President Ronald Reagan 's 1981 policy successes in the Democratic controlled House was due in no small measure to Minority Leader Michel 's effectiveness in wooing so-called " Reagan Democrats " to support , for instance , the Administration 's landmark budget reconciliation bill . There are occasions , of course , when minority leaders will fault the legislative initiatives of their President . On an administration proposal that could adversely affect his district , Michel stated that he might " abdicate my leadership role [ on this issue ] since I ca n't harmonize my own views with the administration 's . " Minority Leader Gephardt , as another example , has publicly opposed a number of President Clinton 's legislative initiatives from " fast track " trade authority to various budget issues .
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
In terms of ship categories , Greek companies have 22.6 % of the world 's tankers and 16.1 % of the world 's bulk carriers ( in dwt ) . An additional equivalent of 27.45 % of the world 's tanker dwt is on order , with another 12.7 % of bulk carriers also on order . Shipping accounts for an estimated 6 % of Greek GDP , employs about 160,000 people ( 4 % of the workforce ) , and represents 1/3 of the country 's trade deficit . Earnings from shipping amounted to €14.1 billion in 2011 , while between 2000 and 2010 Greek shipping contributed a total of €140 billion ( half of the country 's public debt in 2009 and 3.5 times the receipts from the European Union in the period 2000–2013 ) . The 2011 ECSA report showed that there are approximately 750 Greek shipping companies in operation .
Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of Romanitas . Rome 's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities , including their traditional gods , the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the diis deabusque omnibus ( all the gods and goddesses ) . They also brought Roman " domestic " deities and cult practices with them . By the same token , the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military .

In the Regal era , a rex sacrorum ( king of the sacred rites ) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king ( rex ) or in his absence , and announced the public festivals . He had little or no civil authority . With the abolition of monarchy , the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased . By the late Republican era , the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia . The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title : his religious duties still included the daily , ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus .
The economic output of the metropolitan area alone is worth more than one third of national GDP around $ 6.5billion in terms of nominal GDP NR.s 550 billion approximately per year $ 2200 per capital income approx three times national average . Kathmandu exports handicrafts , artworks , garments , carpets , pashmina , paper ; trade accounts for 21 % of its finances. [ which ? ] Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19 % of the revenue that Kathmandu generates . Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products . Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture ( 9 % ) , education ( 6 % ) , transport ( 6 % ) , and hotels and restaurants ( 5 % ) . Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls .
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .
The first amendment to the US Constitution states " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " The two parts , known as the " establishment clause " and the " free exercise clause " respectively , form the textual basis for the Supreme Court 's interpretations of the " separation of church and state " doctrine . Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America 's doctrine for church-state separation : no coercion in religious matters , no expectation to support a religion against one 's will , and religious liberty encompasses all religions . In sum , citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith , any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary , and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism .
A pater familias was the senior priest of his household . He offered daily cult to his lares and penates , and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth . His wife ( mater familias ) was responsible for the household 's cult to Vesta . In rural estates , bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines ( lararia ) and their deities . Household cults had state counterparts . In Vergil 's Aeneid , Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the lares and penates from Troy , along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta .
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine 's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt . Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine 's Monastery is exceptional . On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background . In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background . The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets , and two contemporary figure , " Abbot Longinos " and " John the Deacon " . The mosaic was probably created in 565/6 .
As a consequence of his heart attack , Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm , which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25 , 1957 . This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand . The stroke had caused an aphasia . The president also suffered from Crohn 's disease , chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine , which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9 , 1956 . To treat the intestinal block , surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine . His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis . Eisenhower 's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits , but he still indulged in alcohol . During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29 , 1959 ; however , before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower " drank several gin-and-tonics , and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner " .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
The City of New York has an official television station run by the NYC Media Group and broadcasting from Bronx Community College , and Cablevision operates News 12 The Bronx , both of which feature programming based in the Bronx . Co-op City was the first area in the Bronx , and the first in New York beyond Manhattan , to have its own cable television provider . The local public-access television station BronxNet originates from Herbert H. Lehman College , the borough 's only four year CUNY school , and provides government-access television ( GATV ) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents .
According to the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-Hispanic Black or African American , 10.9 % of the population was non-Hispanic White , 3.4 % non-Hispanic Asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-Hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-Hispanic ) . The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
Since then , the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party 's nominee for President , starting with a vote of 2-1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928 , followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt . ( Both had been Governors of New York , but Republican former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey won only 28 % of the Bronx 's vote in 1948 against 55 % for Pres . Harry Truman , the winning Democrat , and 17 % for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives . It was only 32 years earlier , by contrast , that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency , Charles Evans Hughes , had won 42.6 % of the Bronx 's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson 's 49.8 % and Socialist candidate Allan Benson 's 7.3 % . )
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence . Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement , since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators . This practice is controversial , with for example , New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers .
The largest ethnic groups are Newar ( 29.6 % ) , Matwali ( 25.1 % Sunuwar , Gurung , Magars , Tamang etc . ) , Khas Brahmins ( 20.51 % ) and Chettris ( 18.5 % ) . Tamangs originating from surrounding hill districts can be seen in Kathmandu . More recently , other hill ethnic groups and Caste groups from Terai have come to represent a substantial proportion of the city 's population . The major languages are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa , while English is understood by many , particularly in the service industry . The major religions are Hinduism and Buddhism .
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
With the abatement of persecution , St. Jerome acknowledged the Empire as a bulwark against evil but insisted that " imperial honours " were contrary to Christian teaching . His was an authoritative but minority voice : most Christians showed no qualms in the veneration of even " pagan " emperors . The peace of the emperors was the peace of God ; as far as the Church was concerned , internal dissent and doctrinal schism were a far greater problem . The solution came from a hitherto unlikely source : as pontifex maximus Constantine I favoured the " Catholic Church of the Christians " against the Donatists because :
Rome 's government , politics and religion were dominated by an educated , male , landowning military aristocracy . Approximately half Rome 's population were slave or free non-citizens . Most others were plebeians , the lowest class of Roman citizens . Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights ; far fewer could actually exercise them . Women had no vote . However , all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices , in the name of the senate and people of Rome . " In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine , just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans " .
The " religious test " clause has been interpreted to cover both elected officials and appointed ones , career civil servants as well as political appointees . Religious beliefs or the lack of them have therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution . Seven states , however , have language included in their Bill of Rights , Declaration of Rights , or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs , though some of these have been successfully challenged in court . These states are Texas , Massachusetts , Maryland , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Tennessee .
The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians ; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic , and the proprietors of Perth Amboy , New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers . The Province of West Jersey had declared , in 1681 , that there should be no religious test for office . An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope , which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution . That law was replaced by 1799 .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
When infection attacks the body , anti-infective drugs can suppress the infection . Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist , depending on the type of organism targeted ; they include antibacterial ( antibiotic ; including antitubercular ) , antiviral , antifungal and antiparasitic ( including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic ) agents . Depending on the severity and the type of infection , the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection , or may be applied topically . Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics . Sometimes , multiple antibiotics are used in case there is resistance to one antibiotic . Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses . Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria . The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin , cephalosporins , aminoglycosides , macrolides , quinolones and tetracyclines . [ citation needed ]
Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra , composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran . Zarathustra 's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda ( God in the form of supreme wisdom ) . The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices , made freely in this present life , in the afterlife . The importance placed on thought , action , responsibility , and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by , and inspired a number of , Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu .
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
Contemporary humanism entails a qualified optimism about the capacity of people , but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely good or that all people can live up to the Humanist ideals without help . If anything , there is recognition that living up to one 's potential is hard work and requires the help of others . The ultimate goal is human flourishing ; making life better for all humans , and as the most conscious species , also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole . The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now , and leaving the world a better place for those who come after . In 1925 , the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned : " The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled ; and man , who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels , has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature . It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts " .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the English language in this sense . The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when German historian and philologist Georg Voigt used humanism to describe Renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the Italian Renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially Italy .
While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948 , actual implementation had been slow . Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953 , saying " I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia , including the Federal Government , and any segregation in the Armed Forces " . When he encountered opposition from the services , he used government control of military spending to force the change through , stating " Wherever Federal Funds are expended ... , I do not see how any American can justify ... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds " .
In November 1945 , Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army . His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . However , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets , Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon . Indeed , Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese , writing , " First , the Japanese were ready to surrender and it was n't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . Second , I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " Initially , Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets . He even visited Warsaw in 1945 . Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . However , by mid-1947 , as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated , Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion .

^Note 2 : in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows : " Article IV . Section 10 . No person within this state shall , upon any pretense , be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience , nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rate , for the building or repairing any place of worship , or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry , contrary to what he believes to be right , or hath voluntarily engaged to do . No one religious society shall ever be established in this state , in preference to another ; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles . "
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
Augustus ' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals . They were given high-status seating at games and theatres . The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia , wife of Augustus . They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century , after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians . When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , he took steps toward the dissolution of the order . His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta 's sacred fire and vacated her temple .
This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing . Following the airport 's master plan , Infraero built a second runway , which was finished in 2006 . In 2007 , the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers . The main building 's third floor , with 12 thousand square meters , has a panoramic deck , a food court , shops , four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people , and space for exhibitions . Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces . The airport is located about 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) from the central area of Brasília , outside the metro system . The area outside the airport 's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília 's central district . The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars . The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines ( TAM , GOL , Azul , WebJET , Trip and Avianca ) , in addition to a number of international carriers . In 2012 , Brasília 's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium , formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company , with a 50 % stake each . During the 25-year concession , the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year .
His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading . Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children , and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline , usually from David . His mother , previously a member ( with David ) of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites , joined the International Bible Students Association , later known as Jehovah 's Witnesses . The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915 , though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students . His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother , who felt that warfare was " rather wicked , " but she did not overrule him . While speaking of himself in 1948 , Eisenhower said he was " one of the most deeply religious men I know " though unattached to any " sect or organization " . He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953 .
Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co-ordinate their work , share information , and get help quickly . In recent years , vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatching of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and updating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real-time basis . Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches , whistles , police notebooks and " ticket books " or citations .
In November 1956 , Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British , French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis , receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt . Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
Edgar took the first turn at school , and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery . Edgar asked for a second year , Dwight consented and worked for a second year . At that time , a friend " Swede " Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school , since no tuition was required . Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S . Senator , Joseph L. Bristow . Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition , he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy . He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911 .
Witnesses believe that a " little flock " go to heaven , but that the hope for life after death for the majority of " other sheep " involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon . They interpret Revelation 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000 , who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth . Jehovah 's Witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon , but that God is the final judge . During Christ 's millennial reign , most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever ; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium .
The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
In the wake of religious riots in Egypt , the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to " ancestral gods " or suffer a penalty : only Jews were exempt . Decius ' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults ; no ancestral gods were specified by name . The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman . Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective ; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults , but apostasy was sought , rather than capital punishment . A year after its due deadline , the edict expired .
" We used a technique of laying our program out in general debate , " he said . When we got to the amendment phase , we would offer our program as a substitute for the Johnson proposal . If we lost in the Committee of the Whole , then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that . And if we lost on the motion to recommit , our Republican members had a choice : They could vote against the Johnson program and say we did our best to come up with a better alternative . Or they could vote for it and make the same argument . Usually we lost ; but when you 're only 140 out of 435 , you do n't expect to win many .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
Between 1949 and the 1980s , telephone communications in Greece were a state monopoly by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization , better known by its acronym , OTE . Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s , OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe . Since 2011 , the company 's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40 % stake , while the Greek state continues to own 10 % of the company 's shares . OTE owns several subsidiaries across the Balkans , including Cosmote , Greece 's top mobile telecommunications provider , Cosmote Romania and Albanian Mobile Communications .
The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar , who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy ; he was murdered soon after . Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors , and offered similar cult to Caesar 's successor , Augustus , who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship ; it might prove fatal . By the end of his reign , Augustus had appropriated Rome 's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his " reformed " and thoroughly integrated system of government . Towards the end of his life , he cautiously allowed cult to his numen . By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed , first in the Eastern Provinces , then in the West . Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context ; bathhouses , shrines and temples to Roman and local deities , amphitheatres and festivals . In the early Imperial period , the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship .
In the United States , August Vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . O.W . Wilson , a student of Vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita , Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . Strategies employed by O.W . Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . During the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
Jefferson and Madison 's approach was not the only one taken in the eighteenth century . Jefferson 's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill , chiefly supported by Patrick Henry , which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination , but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it . Similarly , the Constitution of Massachusetts originally provided that " no subject shall be hurt , molested , or restrained , in his person , liberty , or estate , for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ... provided he doth not disturb the public peace , or obstruct others in their religious worship , " ( Article II ) but also that :
While the decision ( with four dissents ) ultimately upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools , the majority opinion ( by Justice Hugo Black ) and the dissenting opinions ( by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge and Justice Robert H. Jackson ) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a " wall between church and state " or a " separation of Church from State " : their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall . Rutledge , on behalf of the four dissenting justices , took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case : " Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia 's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment , now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth . " Writing separately , Justice Jackson argued that " [ T ] here are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation . In fact , the undertones of the opinion , advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State , seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters . "
The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower 's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency . Meanwhile , Columbia University 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including Leonard McCollum , the president of Continental Oil ; Frank Abrams , the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey ; Bob Kleberg , the president of the King Ranch ; H. J. Porter , a Texas oil executive ; Bob Woodruff , the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation ; and Clarence Francis , the chairman of General Foods .
When the Majority Leader 's party loses control of the House , and if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy , convention suggests that they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip , respectively . As the minority party has one less leadership position after losing the speaker 's chair , there may be a contest for the remaining leadership positions . Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker seeking the Minority Leader post to retain the House party leadership , as the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections . Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran successfully for Minority Leader in the 112th Congress .

Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south , although the northern ( primarily Germany , France and Great Britain ) and southern universities ( primarily Italy ) did have many elements in common . Latin was the language of the university , used for all texts , lectures , disputations and examinations . Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic , natural philosophy , and metaphysics ; while Hippocrates , Galen , and Avicenna were used for medicine . Outside of these commonalities , great differences separated north and south , primarily in subject matter . Italian universities focused on law and medicine , while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology . There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus , so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means . There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities . English , French and German universities usually awarded bachelor 's degrees , with the exception of degrees in theology , for which the doctorate was more common . Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates . The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions , while in the south students often went on to professional positions . The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris . Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna . Among the southern universities , a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy , which followed the pattern of Bologna as a " self-regulating , independent corporation of scholars " and those of southern Italy and Iberia , which were " founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government . "
As the 1954 congressional elections approached , and it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses , Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses , and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP . Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate , progressive Republican : " I have just one purpose ... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country . If the right wing wants a fight , they are going to get it ... before I end up , either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I wo n't be with them anymore . "
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur . The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this sacred space , and only later referred to a building . Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space ; its ancient boundary ( pomerium ) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough ; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state . In Rome , the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra ( Sacred Way ) and the pomerium . Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur , who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before , during and after an act of sacrifice . Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice , errant rites ( vitium ) or an unacceptable plan of action . If an unfavourable sign was given , the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen , consult with his augural colleagues , or abandon the project . Magistrates could use their right of augury ( ius augurum ) to adjourn and overturn the process of law , but were obliged to base their decision on the augur 's observations and advice . For Cicero , himself an augur , this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic . By his time ( mid 1st century BC ) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices , whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum .
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball . The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue , a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships . With the famous facade , the short right field porch and Monument Park , Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball 's greatest players including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Whitey Ford , Yogi Berra , Mickey Mantle , Reggie Jackson , Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
As of 2010 , 46.29 % ( 584,463 ) of Bronx residents aged five and older spoke Spanish at home , while 44.02 % ( 555,767 ) spoke English , 2.48 % ( 31,361 ) African languages , 0.91 % ( 11,455 ) French , 0.90 % ( 11,355 ) Italian , 0.87 % ( 10,946 ) various Indic languages , 0.70 % ( 8,836 ) other Indo-European languages , and Chinese was spoken at home by 0.50 % ( 6,610 ) of the population over the age of five . In total , 55.98 % ( 706,783 ) of the Bronx 's population age five and older spoke a language at home other than English . A Garifuna-speaking community from Honduras and Guatemala also makes the Bronx its home .
In the wake of the Republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . Augustus , the first Roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . So-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire . Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . This was the context for Rome 's conflict with Christianity , which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
In December 1943 , President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . The following month , he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 . He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord , the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany .
In 2014 YouTube said that 300 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute , three times more than one year earlier and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the U.S .

According to third-party web analytics providers , Alexa and SimilarWeb , YouTube is the third most visited website in the world , as of June 2015 ; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally , attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month .
Between 1975 and 2009 , Olympic Airways ( known after 2003 as Olympic Airlines ) was the country’s state-owned flag carrier , but financial problems led to its privatization and relaunch as Olympic Air in 2009 . Both Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air have won awards for their services ; in 2009 and 2011 , Aegean Airlines was awarded the " Best regional airline in Europe " award by Skytrax , and also has two gold and one silver awards by the ERA , while Olympic Air holds one silver ERA award for " Airline of the Year " as well as a " Condé Nast Traveller 2011 Readers Choice Awards : Top Domestic Airline " award .
The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party , and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader . Unlike the Majority Leader , the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress . If the Minority Leader 's party takes control of the House , and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats , the Minority Leader is usually the party 's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress , while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader . The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
Yet another may have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related financial services ( such as mortgage loans or insurance policies ) offered in some areas of the Bronx — a process known as redlining . Others have suggested a " planned shrinkage " of municipal services , such as fire-fighting . There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable ( or more costly ) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings .
The Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the President of Brazil . The palace was designed , along with the rest of the city of Brasília , by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958 . One of the first structures built in the republic 's new capital city , the " Alvorada " lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Paranoá . The principles of simplicity and modernity , that in the past characterized the great works of architecture , motivated Niemeyer . The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box , softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns . The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement , landing , and second floor . The auditorium , kitchen , laundry , medical center , and administration offices are at basement level . The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing . The second floor has four suites , two apartments , and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace . The building also has a library , a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool , a music room , two dining rooms and various meeting rooms . A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
Raymond B. Bragg , the associate editor of The New Humanist , sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead , Charles Francis Potter , and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference . Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 . Potter 's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
During the Eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago ) , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . At the beginning of the period , Australia and Antarctica remained connected , and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters , distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high . But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma , the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica , and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents . The Antarctic region cooled down , and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze , sending cold water and ice floes north , reinforcing the cooling . The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago . [ citation needed ]
Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe , although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals . The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár ( Alba Regia ) had a mosaic decoration in the apse . It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen , executed in the first decades of the 11th century . The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century . The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal . It was executed by Venetian craftsmen .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma . Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia . The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow . Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high . Laurentia , Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia . Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole . Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere , and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean , Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean .
While the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . During the Punic crisis , popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy ; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with Roman Bacchus . Official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . Much later , a statue of Marsyas , the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus ' censorship . Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . Where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; Liber 's festival continued .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
Protestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation , today regarded as branches . Some of these movements have a common lineage , sometimes directly spawning individual denominations . Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations , this section discusses only the largest denominational families , or branches , widely considered to be a part of Protestantism . These are , in alphabetical order : Adventist , Anglican , Baptist , Calvinist ( Reformed ) , Lutheran , Methodist and Pentecostal . A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed .
Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff , but did not affect the campaign . One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust . Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage , but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates . The second issue centered on Eisenhower 's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance . Just two weeks prior to the election , Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there . He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO ; finally , he stressed a corruption-free , frugal administration at home .
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
Penny Marshall 's 1990 film Awakenings , which was nominated for several Oscars , is based on neurologist Oliver Sacks ' 1973 account of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of encephalitis but briefly responded to the drug L-dopa . Robin Williams played the physician ; Robert De Niro was one of the patients who emerged from a catatonic ( frozen ) state . The home of Williams ' character was shot not far from Sacks ' actual City Island residence . A 1973 Yorkshire Television documentary and " A Kind of Alaska " , a 1985 play by Harold Pinter , were also based on Sacks ' book .
Besides being the political center , Brasília is an important economic center . Brasília has the highest city gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 99.5 billion reais representing 3.76 % of the total Brazilian GDP . The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function . Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District . Being a city registered by UNESCO , the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software , film , video , and gemology among others , with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance , preserving the city property .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier . Traditionally , these festivals were celebrated by Newars . In recent years , these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well . As the capital of the Republic of Nepal , various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu . With mass migration to the city , the cultures of Khas from the west , Kirats from the east , Bon/Tibetan from the north , and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously . The festivities such as the Ghode ( horse ) Jatra , Indra Jatra , Dashain Durga Puja festivals , Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm . Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics . These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings , as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion .
In Canada , the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was founded in 1729 , making it the first police force in present-day Canada . It was followed in 1834 by the Toronto Police , and in 1838 by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City . A national force , the Dominion Police , was founded in 1868 . Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament , but its responsibilities quickly grew . The famous Royal Northwest Mounted Police was founded in 1873 . The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
The small woolen dolls called Maniae , hung on the Compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania , as Mother of the Lares . The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus , traditionally Rome 's Republican founder and first consul . Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
That evening , Eisenhower 's body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene , Kansas , the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an American president . His body arrived on April 2 , and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library . The president 's body was buried as a General of the Army . The family used an $ 80 standard soldier 's casket , and dressed Eisenhower 's body in his famous short green jacket . His only medals worn were : the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , and the Legion of Merit . Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud , who died at age 3 in 1921 . His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979 .
Like the Speaker of the House , the Minority Leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position . When Nancy Pelosi , D-CA , became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress , she had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress . When her predecessor , Richard Gephardt , D-MO , became minority leader in the 104th House , he had been in the House for almost 20 years , had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years , had been a 1988 presidential candidate , and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections . Gephardt 's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel , R-IL , who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House . Michel 's predecessor , Republican John Rhodes of Arizona , was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service .
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
Counting shipping as quasi-exports and in terms of monetary value , Greece ranked 4th globally in 2011 having " exported " shipping services worth 17,704.132 million $ ; only Denmark , Germany and South Korea ranked higher during that year . Similarly counting shipping services provided to Greece by other countries as quasi-imports and the difference between " exports " and " imports " as a " trade balance " , Greece in 2011 ranked in the latter second behind Germany , having " imported " shipping services worth 7,076.605 million US $ and having run a " trade surplus " of 10,712.342 million US $ .
Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD , when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet . This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature . Early Armenian literature was written by the " father of Armenian history " , Moses of Chorene , who authored The History of Armenia . The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD . The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature . This period of time , during which Armenian culture flourished , is known as the Revival period ( Zartonki sherchan ) . The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis , almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe , were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism . Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience , and preferred them over classical Armenian ( grabar ) . This period ended after the Hamidian massacres , when Armenians experienced turbulent times . As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed , writers like Paruyr Sevak , Gevork Emin , Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature .
The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation . Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ : " As a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , O God . " Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
With the initial investment of £4,200 , the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades , of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and " on the game . " The force was a success after its first year , and his men had " established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives . " Word of this success spread quickly , and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800 , transforming it from a private to public police agency ; now the oldest police force in the world . Colquhoun published a book on the experiment , The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames . It found receptive audiences far outside London , and inspired similar forces in other cities , notably , New York City , Dublin , and Sydney .
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003–04 . This fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . In view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in Kathmandu are mainly by road and air . Kathmandu is connected by the Tribhuvan Highway to the south , Prithvi Highway to the west and Araniko Highway to the north . The BP Highway , connecting Kathmandu to the eastern part of Nepal is under construction .
Eric P. Hamp in his 2012 Indo-European family tree , groups the Armenian language along with Greek and Ancient Macedonian ( " Helleno-Macedonian " ) in the Pontic Indo-European ( also called Helleno-Armenian ) subgroup . In Hamp 's view the homeland of this subgroup is the northeast coast of the Black Sea and its hinterlands . He assumes that they migrated from there southeast through the Caucasus with the Armenians remaining after Batumi while the pre-Greeks proceeded westwards along the southern coast of the Black Sea .
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been " fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution " , TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that " what Gutenberg did for writing , online video can now do for face-to-face communication " . Anderson asserted that it 's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance , and that video contributors may be about to launch " the biggest learning cycle in human history . " In education , for example , the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan 's cousin into what Forbes ' Michael Noer called " the largest school in the world " , with technology poised to disrupt how people learn .
Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-four , and Alan Rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over Witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation " , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control .
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style , free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space . Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .
Others , such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . However , the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman religio . The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons , the apparent shrinking of the sun 's disc , two moons in a daylit sky , a cosmic battle between sun and moon , a rain of red-hot stones , a bloody sweat on statues , and blood in fountains and on ears of corn : all were expiated by sacrifice of " greater victims " . The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural ; sheep become goats , a hen become a cock ( and vice versa ) – these were expiated with " lesser victims " . The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina , singing a hymn to avert disaster : a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation . Religious restitution is proved only by Rome 's victory .
The economic output of the metropolitan area alone is worth more than one third of national GDP around $ 6.5billion in terms of nominal GDP NR.s 550 billion approximately per year $ 2200 per capital income approx three times national average . Kathmandu exports handicrafts , artworks , garments , carpets , pashmina , paper ; trade accounts for 21 % of its finances. [ which ? ] Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19 % of the revenue that Kathmandu generates . Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products . Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture ( 9 % ) , education ( 6 % ) , transport ( 6 % ) , and hotels and restaurants ( 5 % ) . Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
The apse mosaic of the Gelati Monastery is a rare example of mosaic use in Georgia . Began by king David IV and completed by his son Demetrius I of Georgia , the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels . The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids . The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople . Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other , lesser known sites . The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the Pitsunda Cathedral have been inspired by Roman prototypes . In Tsromi the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme . Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text .
Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence . Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement , since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators . This practice is controversial , with for example , New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers .
The largest ethnic groups are Newar ( 29.6 % ) , Matwali ( 25.1 % Sunuwar , Gurung , Magars , Tamang etc . ) , Khas Brahmins ( 20.51 % ) and Chettris ( 18.5 % ) . Tamangs originating from surrounding hill districts can be seen in Kathmandu . More recently , other hill ethnic groups and Caste groups from Terai have come to represent a substantial proportion of the city 's population . The major languages are Nepali and Nepal Bhasa , while English is understood by many , particularly in the service industry . The major religions are Hinduism and Buddhism .
In May 2014 , prior to the launch of YouTube 's subscription-based Music Key service , the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were " undervalued " in comparison to other streaming services , and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014 , Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " Stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . However , YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal .
Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term , but as with other decisions , he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again . During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955 , he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP 's potential candidates ; the group , in addition to his doctor , concluded a second term was well advised , and he announced in February 1956 he would run again . Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon 's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket ; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition . He personally favored Robert B. Anderson , a Democrat , who rejected his offer ; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party . In 1956 , Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide , with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6 % of the popular vote . The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .
Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely , particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany . They included nonconformists like the Puritans , who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England . Despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches . The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established Church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .
The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower 's resignation in December 1950 , when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe . Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31 , 1952 , and he resumed his presidency of Columbia . He held this position until January 20 , 1953 , when he became the President of the United States .
A central teaching of Jehovah 's Witnesses is that the current world era , or " system of things " , entered the " last days " in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ , leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably . They consider all other present-day religions to be false , identifying them with " Babylon the Great " , or the " harlot " , of Revelation 17 , and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations , which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17 . This development will mark the beginning of the " great tribulation " . Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah 's Witnesses , an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon , during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ 's " sheep " , or true followers , will be destroyed . After Armageddon , God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth , which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden . After Armageddon , most of those who had died before God 's intervention will gradually be resurrected during " judgment day " lasting for one thousand years . This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds . At the end of the thousand years , Christ will hand all authority back to God . Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind . Those who fail will be destroyed , along with Satan and his demons . The end result will be a fully tested , glorified human race .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it . They sought to create a citizenry ( frequently including women ) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions . This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis , today known as the humanities : grammar , rhetoric , history , poetry and moral philosophy . As a program to revive the cultural – and particularly the literary – legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity , Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like Rabelais or Erasmus as is still sometimes popularly believed .
Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods , so did some individual Romans . In the mid-to-late Republican era , and probably much earlier , many of Rome 's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult , along with a share of their divinity . Most notably in the very late Republic , the Julii claimed Venus Genetrix as ancestor ; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult . The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil 's poetic , Imperial vision of the past .
Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later Middle Ages and the Early Modern period . The 19th-century German historian Georg Voigt ( 1827–91 ) identified Petrarch as the first Renaissance humanist . Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was " the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness " . According to Petrarch , what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors . For Petrarch and Boccaccio , the greatest master was Cicero , whose prose became the model for both learned ( Latin ) and vernacular ( Italian ) prose .
Since June 2007 , YouTube 's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products . This required YouTube 's content to be transcoded into Apple 's preferred video standard , H.264 , a process that took several months . YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV , iPod Touch and the iPhone . In July 2010 , the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 , avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls . The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform . In September 2012 , YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone , following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system . According to GlobalWebIndex , YouTube was used by 35 % of smartphone users between April and June 2013 , making it the third most used app .
Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century , and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement ( 1140 ) . The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary , St John and the two patron saints , Cipriano and Cipriana . When the church was demolished in the 19th century , the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia . It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s .
In 1566 , the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited . By the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . On July 9 , 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order . In 1808 , the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil , because of the French invasion of Portugal . King João VI established the " Intendência Geral de Polícia " ( General Police Intendancy ) for investigations . He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809 . In 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 .
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
All police officers in the United Kingdom , whatever their actual rank , are 'constables ' in terms of their legal position . This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner . However , certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations , such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect 's house ( section 18 PACE in England and Wales ) by an officer of the rank of Inspector , or the power to authorize a suspect 's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent .
Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature . Published in 2008 , The World In Grey : Dom Bosco 's Prophecy , by author Ryan J. Lucero , tells an apocalypticle story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco . According to Don Bosco 's prophecy : " Between parallels 15 and 20 , around a lake which shall be formed ; A great civilization will thrive , and that will be the Promised Land . " Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S , where an artificial lake ( Paranoá Lake ) was formed . Don Bosco is Brasília 's patron saint .
YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate , and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site 's terms of service . In July 2008 , the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was " unimpressed " with YouTube 's system for policing its videos , and argued that " proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content " . YouTube responded by stating :
Punjab ( Urdu , Punjabi : پنجاب , panj-āb , " five waters " : listen ( help·info ) ) , also spelled Panjab , is the most populous of the four provinces of Pakistan . It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres ( 79,284 square miles ) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011 , approximately 56 % of the country 's total population . Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore . Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east . In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south , Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north .

That evening , Eisenhower 's body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene , Kansas , the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an American president . His body arrived on April 2 , and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library . The president 's body was buried as a General of the Army . The family used an $ 80 standard soldier 's casket , and dressed Eisenhower 's body in his famous short green jacket . His only medals worn were : the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , and the Legion of Merit . Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud , who died at age 3 in 1921 . His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979 .
The Taragaon Museum presents the modern history of the Kathmandu Valley . It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley , documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century . The actual structure of the Museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu . It was designed by Carl Pruscha ( master-planner of the Kathmandy Valley ) in 1970 and constructed in 1971 . Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon hostel into the Taragaon Museum . The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements , as well as the use of circle , triangles and squares . The Museum is within a short walk from the Boudhnath stupa , which itself can be seen from the Museum tower .
The " religious test " clause has been interpreted to cover both elected officials and appointed ones , career civil servants as well as political appointees . Religious beliefs or the lack of them have therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution . Seven states , however , have language included in their Bill of Rights , Declaration of Rights , or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs , though some of these have been successfully challenged in court . These states are Texas , Massachusetts , Maryland , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Tennessee .
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible , education on all levels got a strong boost . By the middle of the eighteenth century , the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent , in Scotland 65 per cent , and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write . Colleges and universities were founded . For example , the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later . About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century , including Yale ( 1701 ) . Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
The second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . Though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers . Because sola scriptura placed the Bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between Christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was Christocentric .
Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel , who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ . In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exhaltation of Adam . In the apse the Ascension of Christ . The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "

In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow . Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America ( the Western Interior Seaway ) and Europe , then receded late in the period , leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds . At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression , one-third of Earth 's present land area was submerged . The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk ; indeed , more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic . Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather , the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium ; this made the oceans more saturated , as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton . These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine . Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas 's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation . Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China . In the area that is now India , massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene .
According to the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-Hispanic Black or African American , 10.9 % of the population was non-Hispanic White , 3.4 % non-Hispanic Asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-Hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-Hispanic ) . The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
The Bronx Museum of the Arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx . Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from Africa , Asia and Latin America , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
In 1913 the Zliten mosaic , a Roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests , hunting and everyday life , was discovered in the Libyan town of Zliten . In 2000 archaeologists working in Leptis Magna , Libya , uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD . The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer , four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground , and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue , staring at his slain opponent . The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa . The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a " masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii . "
As the 1954 congressional elections approached , and it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses , Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses , and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP . Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate , progressive Republican : " I have just one purpose ... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country . If the right wing wants a fight , they are going to get it ... before I end up , either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I wo n't be with them anymore . "
The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma . During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana . Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and , as the period progressed , drifted toward the South Pole . Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents ( since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier ) , but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period , causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them . Also , Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia . The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this . By the end of the period , Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated .
In 2003 , the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania . The panels depict real or fantastic animal , floral , solar and geometric representations . Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church , built some time between the 10th and 11th century . Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence . The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
Until the 1980s , the governor of the Federal District was appointed by the Federal Government , and the laws of Brasília were issued by the Brazilian Federal Senate . With the Constitution of 1988 Brasília gained the right to elect its Governor , and a District Assembly ( Câmara Legislativa ) was elected to exercise legislative power . The Federal District does not have a Judicial Power of its own . The Judicial Power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories . Currently , Brazil does not have any territories , therefore , for now the courts serve only cases from the Federal District .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
Praça dos Três Poderes ( Portuguese for Square of the Three Powers ) is a plaza in Brasília . The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza : the Executive , represented by the Palácio do Planalto ( presidential office ) ; the Legislative , represented by the National Congress ( Congresso Nacional ) ; and the Judicial branch , represented by the Supreme Federal Court ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) . It is a tourist attraction in Brasília , designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously .
The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma . During the Silurian , Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation . The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Rheic Ocean , a seaway of Iapetus Ocean ( now in between Avalonia and Laurentia ) , and newly formed Ural Ocean .
Jefferson 's concept of " separation of church and state " first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S. , 98 U.S. 145 ( 1878 ) . In that case , the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US , determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom , " The word 'religion ' is not defined in the Constitution . We must go elsewhere , therefore , to ascertain its meaning , and nowhere more appropriately , we think , than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted . " The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . Quoting the " separation " paragraph from Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , the court concluded that , " coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure , it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . "
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
The major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in Brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . Industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8 % , Services 28.7 % , Industry 10.2 % , Commerce 6.1 % , Agribusiness 0.2 % .
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( Ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian . Geologically , the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . Throughout the early Paleozoic , the Earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea , which included most of the Earth 's land area .
The Armenians collective has , at times , constituted a Christian " island " in a mostly Muslim region . There is , however , a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims , known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race , while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years . The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States . Later on , the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin , the original seat of the Catholicosate . In 1441 , a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi , while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia . Therefore , since 1441 , there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges , and with their respective jurisdictions . The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia .
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends . According to Swayambhu Purana , present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake names " Nagdaha " as it was full of snakes . The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa Manjusri with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land . After sometimes , a demon named Banasur closed the outlet and the valley was again a lake . Then lots Krishna came to Nepal , killed Banasur and again drained out water . He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud 's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner 's Behaviorism . The approach emphasizes an individual 's inherent drive towards self-actualization and creativity . Psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow introduced a positive , humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s . Other sources include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
Serological methods are highly sensitive , specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms . These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen . The antigen , usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent , is bound by the antibody . This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways , dependent upon the test . For example , " Strep throat " is often diagnosed within minutes , and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent , S. pyogenes , that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab . Serological tests , if available , are usually the preferred route of identification , however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration . Some serological methods are extremely costly , although when commonly used , such as with the " strep test " , they can be inexpensive .
Kathmandu is home to Nepali cinema and theaters . The city contains several theaters , including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path , the Ganga Theatre , the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982 . The M. Art Theater is based in the city . The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival , attracting artists from all over the world . A mini theater is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square , established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee .
The small woolen dolls called Maniae , hung on the Compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania , as Mother of the Lares . The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus , traditionally Rome 's Republican founder and first consul . Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example .
The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map , made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba , Jordan . It was rediscovered in 1894 . The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land . It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south , and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert . The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem , at the center of the map . The map is enriched with many naturalistic features , like animals , fishing boats , bridges and palm trees
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft , according to Foucault the police had an administrative , economic and social duty ( " procuring abundance " ) . It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d'état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population ( and unwittingly supervising the population ) , which , according to mercantilist theory , was to be the main strength of the state . Thus , its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns , urban planning ( which was important because of the miasma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . ) , and surveillance of prices .

Between 2005 and 2011 , Greece has had the highest percentage increase in industrial output compared to 2005 levels out of all European Union members , with an increase of 6 % . Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010 , with domestic output decreasing by 5.8 % and industrial production in general by 13.4 % . Currently , Greece is ranked third in the European Union in the production of marble ( over 920,000 tons ) , after Italy and Spain .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .
Angels in the Outfield was Eisenhower 's favorite movie . His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels of Zane Grey . With his excellent memory and ability to focus , Eisenhower was skilled at card games . He learned poker , which he called his " favorite indoor sport , " in Abilene . Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates ' poker losses for payment after graduation , and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him . A classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point , Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
The Bronx has several local newspapers , including The Bronx News , Parkchester News , City News , The Riverdale Press , Riverdale Review , The Bronx Times Reporter , Inner City Press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and Co-Op City Times . Four non-profit news outlets , Norwood News , Mount Hope Monitor , Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough 's poorer communities . The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press , Bernard Stein , won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998 . ( Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959 . )
Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science . In fact , more than 80 % of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained , of which approximately 45 % held university posts . It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable , and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development . There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system , which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world . However , university professors still utilized some autonomy , at least in the sciences , to choose epistemological foundations and methods . For instance , Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction . Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .
Between 1975 and 2009 , Olympic Airways ( known after 2003 as Olympic Airlines ) was the country’s state-owned flag carrier , but financial problems led to its privatization and relaunch as Olympic Air in 2009 . Both Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air have won awards for their services ; in 2009 and 2011 , Aegean Airlines was awarded the " Best regional airline in Europe " award by Skytrax , and also has two gold and one silver awards by the ERA , while Olympic Air holds one silver ERA award for " Airline of the Year " as well as a " Condé Nast Traveller 2011 Readers Choice Awards : Top Domestic Airline " award .
In the original city plan , the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station . Because of the growth of Brasília ( and corresponding growth in the bus fleet ) , today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station ( called Rodoferroviária ) , located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental . The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station . A new bus station was opened in July 2010 . It is on Saída Sul ( South Exit ) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station , and it 's also an inter-state bus station , used only to leave the Federal District .
Since then , the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party 's nominee for President , starting with a vote of 2-1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928 , followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt . ( Both had been Governors of New York , but Republican former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey won only 28 % of the Bronx 's vote in 1948 against 55 % for Pres . Harry Truman , the winning Democrat , and 17 % for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives . It was only 32 years earlier , by contrast , that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency , Charles Evans Hughes , had won 42.6 % of the Bronx 's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson 's 49.8 % and Socialist candidate Allan Benson 's 7.3 % . )
The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( " all the sea " ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean . The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age ; in the U.S. , these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup . Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass , Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in Western Europe , where the Triassic was first studied . In North America , for example , marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west . Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments , such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates .
Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the Iconoclastic destruction of the 8th century . Among the rare examples are the 6th-century Christ in majesty ( or Ezekiel 's Vision ) mosaic in the apse of the Church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times . Nine mosaic panels in the Hagios Demetrios Church , which were made between 634 and 730 , also escaped destruction . Unusually almost all represent Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki , often with suppliants before him .
The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip , who is the chief vote counter for his or her party . The current chief deputy majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry . Within the House Republican Conference , the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House Leadership . The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy whips , led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip , which is the highest appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus . The current senior chief deputy minority whip , John Lewis , has held his post since 1991 .
The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
Since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the Bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " Ten-Year Housing Plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units . The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos ' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx . The IRT White Plains Road Line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . Chains such as Marshalls , Staples , and Target opened stores in the Bronx . More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
Public priests were appointed by the collegia . Once elected , a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine , which offered him lifetime influence , privilege and immunity . Therefore , civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family . Religious law was collegial and traditional ; it informed political decisions , could overturn them , and was difficult to exploit for personal gain . Priesthood was a costly honour : in traditional Roman practice , a priest drew no stipend . Cult donations were the property of the deity , whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds . For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum , permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime 's service in military or political life , or preferably both : it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty . For a freedman or slave , promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile , and opportunities in local politics ; and therefore business . During the Imperial era , priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office ; in effect , it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum . In Rome , the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren , once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities , then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms . The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays , accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt . Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year , provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time .
As a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece 's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country 's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7 % in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) . In order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries , and the IMF , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling €110 billion . In order to secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control . Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( Amendment XIV ) is one of the post-Civil War amendments , intended to secure rights for former slaves . It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others . The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states . While it has not been fully implemented , the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure , through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause , the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states .
The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago . Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the Holocene . In addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene , and are still rising today . The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea . Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont , Quebec , Ontario and Michigan . Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin . Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea , including much of Finland . The region continues to rise , still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe . The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger , immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase , to near its present boundaries .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions ( e.g. , influenza ) . Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted . Other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection , such as vector transmission or sexual transmission , are usually not regarded as " contagious " , and often do not require medical isolation ( sometimes loosely called quarantine ) of victims . However , this specialized connotation of the word " contagious " and " contagious disease " ( easy transmissibility ) is not always respected in popular use .
Another scholar contends that the minority leader position emerged even before 1883 . On the Democratic side , " there were serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873 , " indicating that the " nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership . " Further , when Republicans were in the minority , the party nominated for Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers , including ex-Speaker James Blaine of Maine in 1875 , former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio , in 1876 , 1877 , and 1879 , and ex-Speaker Keifer in 1883 . " It is hard to believe that House partisans would place a man in the speakership when in the majority , and nominate him for this office when in the minority , and not look to him for legislative guidance . " This was not the case , according to some observers , with respect to ex-Speaker Keifer .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite Bronx High School of Science , Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music , DeWitt Clinton High School , High School for Violin and Dance , Bronx Leadership Academy 2 , Bronx International High School , the School for Excellence , the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study , Wings Academy for young adults , The Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice , Validus Preparatory Academy , The Eagle Academy For Young Men , Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School , Bronx Academy of Letters , Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School of American Studies . The Bronx is also home to three of New York City 's most prestigious private , secular schools : Fieldston , Horace Mann , and Riverdale Country School .
The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime-free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap . Mountain building in western North America continued , and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate , isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea . A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe . There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . During the Oligocene , South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America . It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow , rapidly cooling the continent .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
The onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . June and July are oppressively hot . Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °C , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °C . In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . The hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late October .
In the original city plan , the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station . Because of the growth of Brasília ( and corresponding growth in the bus fleet ) , today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station ( called Rodoferroviária ) , located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental . The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station . A new bus station was opened in July 2010 . It is on Saída Sul ( South Exit ) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station , and it 's also an inter-state bus station , used only to leave the Federal District .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
In the wake of religious riots in Egypt , the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to " ancestral gods " or suffer a penalty : only Jews were exempt . Decius ' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults ; no ancestral gods were specified by name . The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman . Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective ; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults , but apostasy was sought , rather than capital punishment . A year after its due deadline , the edict expired .
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers . According to Gopalraj Vansawali , a genealogy of Nepali monarchs , the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas , Mahispalas , Aabhirs , Kirants , and Somavanshi . The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber . During the Kirata era , a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu . In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages , Kathmandu is still called Yambu . Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu , near Manjupattan . During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler , Jitedasti , Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman religio . The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons , the apparent shrinking of the sun 's disc , two moons in a daylit sky , a cosmic battle between sun and moon , a rain of red-hot stones , a bloody sweat on statues , and blood in fountains and on ears of corn : all were expiated by sacrifice of " greater victims " . The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural ; sheep become goats , a hen become a cock ( and vice versa ) – these were expiated with " lesser victims " . The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina , singing a hymn to avert disaster : a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation . Religious restitution is proved only by Rome 's victory .
Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers . Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards . It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk , sugar and spices . Alcohol is widely drunk , and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages . Drinking and driving is illegal , and authorities have a zero tolerance policy . Ailaa and thwon ( alcohol made from rice ) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu , found in all the local bhattis ( alcohol serving eateries ) . Chhyaang , tongba ( fermented millet or barley ) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu . However , shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold . Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus . Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths . In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .
The capital and largest city is Lahore which was the historical capital of the wider Punjab region . Other important cities include Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Gujranwala , Sargodha , Multan , Sialkot , Bahawalpur , Gujrat , Sheikhupura , Jhelum and Sahiwal . Undivided Punjab is home to six rivers , of which five flow through Pakistani Punjab . From west to east , these are : the Indus , Jhelum , Beas , Chenab , Ravi and Sutlej . Nearly 60 % of Pakistan 's population lives in the Punjab . It is the nation 's only province that touches every other province ; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad . In the acronym P-A-K-I-S-T-A-N , the P is for Punjab .
Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions ( e.g. , influenza ) . Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted . Other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection , such as vector transmission or sexual transmission , are usually not regarded as " contagious " , and often do not require medical isolation ( sometimes loosely called quarantine ) of victims . However , this specialized connotation of the word " contagious " and " contagious disease " ( easy transmissibility ) is not always respected in popular use .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
According to Eurostat , Greece 's largest port by tons of goods transported in 2010 is the port of Aghioi Theodoroi , with 17.38 million tons . The Port of Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons , followed by the Port of Piraeus , with 13.2 million tons , and the port of Eleusis , with 12.37 million tons . The total number of goods transported through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million tons , a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the country in 2007 . Since then , Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean 's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO . In 2013 , Piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal , displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists . Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts . Art in Kathmandu is vibrant , demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art , derived from a great number of national , Asian , and global influences . Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas : the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet , closely linked to the country 's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting , including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for . Internationally , the British-based charity , the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
Punjab ( Urdu , Punjabi : پنجاب , panj-āb , " five waters " : listen ( help·info ) ) , also spelled Panjab , is the most populous of the four provinces of Pakistan . It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres ( 79,284 square miles ) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011 , approximately 56 % of the country 's total population . Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore . Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east . In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south , Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north .
Historically , the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient Armenia . The earliest attestations of the exonym Armenia date around the 6th century BC . In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC , Darius I the Great of Persia refers to Urashtu ( in Babylonian ) as Armina ( in Old Persian ; Armina ( ) and Harminuya ( in Elamite ) . In Greek , Αρμένιοι " Armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus ( 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians .
The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta , goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame . A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction , public status and privileges , and could exercise considerable political influence . Upon entering her office , a Vestal was emancipated from her father 's authority . In archaic Roman society , these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man , instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus .

Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .
Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide , Protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the Anglican Communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former Prussian Union of churches ) . Nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity .
This prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy 's highly criticized methods against communism . To facilitate relations with Congress , Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy 's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the White House . This position drew criticism from a number of corners . In late 1953 McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 Senate elections . Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists . Nevertheless , he refused .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
The Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century . One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist . Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation , which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body , blood , soul , and divinity of Christ . They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from God , and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements . They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed . Jehovah 's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " The Witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah 's approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan . Witnesses are taught that association with " worldly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside of Armenia for centuries . For example , a community has existed for over a millennium in the Holy Land , and one of the four quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem has been called the Armenian Quarter . An Armenian Catholic monastic community of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near Venice , Italy . There are also remnants of formerly populous communities in India , Myanmar , Thailand , Belgium , Portugal , Italy , Poland , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria , Romania , Serbia , Ethiopia , Sudan and Egypt .

The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties , including the power of reason . That means that they are allowed to explore God 's creation and , according to Genesis 2:15 , make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way . Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences . Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers , in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ , are to follow God 's commandments . Industry , frugality , calling , discipline , and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code . In particular , Calvin rejected luxury . Therefore , craftsmen , industrialists , and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology . As a result , productivity grew , which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages . In this way , the economy , the sciences , and technology reinforced each other . The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors . The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution . This idea is also known as the " Protestant ethic thesis . "
The Cathedral of Brasília in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil , is an expression of the architect Oscar Niemeyer . This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure , seems with its glass roof reaching up , open , to the heavens . On 31 May 1970 , the Cathedral’s structure was finished , and only the 70 m ( 229.66 ft ) diameter of the circular area were visible . Niemeyer 's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric . The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns . These columns , having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t , represent two hands moving upwards to heaven . The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970 .
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian . However , the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon , and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city . Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places . Buff ( meat of water buffalo ) is very common . There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu , especially among Newars , which is not found in other parts of Nepal . Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago . Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal , pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes . A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo . The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow 's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity . The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly Momo or Chowmein .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy . Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent . Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments , such as the compound light microscope , or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope . Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification . Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen . A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells . This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases , where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly .
Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired . Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans , while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism . In selecting a Chief Justice , Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives , noting privately that Warren " represents the kind of political , economic , and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court ... He has a national name for integrity , uprightness , and courage that , again , I believe we need on the Court " . In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court .
In the 6th century BCE , Taoist teacher Lao Tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . The Silver Rule of Confucianism from Analects XV.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . Humanistic thought is also contained in other Confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in Zuo Zhuan , Ji Liang says , " People is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . So , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; Neishi Guo says , " Gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " Taoist and Confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
On the morning of March 28 , 1969 , at the age of 78 , Eisenhower died in Washington , D.C. of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The following day his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral 's Bethlehem Chapel , where he lay in repose for 28 hours . On March 30 , his body was brought by caisson to the United States Capitol , where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda . On March 31 , Eisenhower 's body was returned to the National Cathedral , where he was given an Episcopal Church funeral service .
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
The Earth of the early Archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . During this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . In 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
In May 2014 , prior to the launch of YouTube 's subscription-based Music Key service , the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were " undervalued " in comparison to other streaming services , and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014 , Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " Stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . However , YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal .
In many ways , the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period . During the Paleocene , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents . Europe and Greenland were still connected . North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge , while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate . The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west , which ended in the succeeding epoch . South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas ( they joined during the Neogene ) ; the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart , with Africa , South America , Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other . Africa was heading north toward Europe , slowly closing the Tethys Ocean , and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas .
After a visit to Brasília , the French writer Simone de Beauvoir complained that all of its superquadras exuded " the same air of elegant monotony , " and other observers have equated the city 's large open lawns , plazas , and fields to wastelands . As the city has matured , some of these have gained adornments , and many have been improved by landscaping , giving some observers a sense of " humanized " spaciousness . Although not fully accomplished , the " Brasília utopia " has produced a city of relatively high quality of life , in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure ( the superquadras ) flanked by small commercial areas , bookstores and cafes ; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit .
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . Some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia , and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber . Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the Bona Dea rites .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
In 295 , a certain Maximilian refused military service ; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath . Both were executed for treason ; both were Christians . At some time around 302 , a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian 's domus and a subsequent ( but undated ) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity . The first ( 303 AD ) " ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts , forbade services to be held , degraded ofﬁcials who were Christians , re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians , and reduced the legal rights of all Christians ... [ Physical ] or capital punishments were not imposed on them " but soon after , several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed . The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice . An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods , in terms that recall the Decian edict .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced : some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred . Others complied . Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian , but powerful and influential ; and some provincial authorities were lenient , notably the Caesar in Gaul , Constantius Chlorus , the father of Constantine I. Diocletian 's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311 , when he asked Christians to pray for him . " This meant an ofﬁcial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire , although one of the tetrarchs , Maximinus Daia , still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313 . "
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes . There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome . During the Roman Republic ( 509–27 BC ) , the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs . Priests married , raised families , and led politically active lives . Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul . The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order , thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny . The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods , especially Jupiter , who embodied just rule . As a result of the Punic Wars ( 264–146 BC ) , when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power , many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success .
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress , with results , " often the reverse of what he has desired " because Members of Congress , " resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this ' . The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking . "
Democracy , social-contract theory , separation of powers , religious freedom , separation of church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers . Some of the philosophers of the English , Scottish , German , and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , John Toland , David Hume , Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , Christian Wolff , Immanuel Kant , and Jean-Jacques Rousseau - had Protestant backgrounds . For example , John Locke , whose political thought was based on " a set of Protestant Christian assumptions " , derived the equality of all humans , including the equality of the genders ( " Adam and Eve " ) , from Genesis 1 , 26-28 . As all persons were created equally free , all governments needed " the consent of the governed . " These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence , which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation : " We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . "
The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the United States , the 15th , but its wide diversity also includes affluent , upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale , Fieldston , Spuyten Duyvil , Schuylerville , Pelham Bay , Pelham Gardens , Morris Park and Country Club . The Bronx , particularly the South Bronx , saw a sharp decline in population , livable housing , and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s , culminating in a wave of arson . Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace in the 1990s into today .

The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
Serological methods are highly sensitive , specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms . These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen . The antigen , usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent , is bound by the antibody . This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways , dependent upon the test . For example , " Strep throat " is often diagnosed within minutes , and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent , S. pyogenes , that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab . Serological tests , if available , are usually the preferred route of identification , however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration . Some serological methods are extremely costly , although when commonly used , such as with the " strep test " , they can be inexpensive .
In December 1943 , President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . The following month , he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 . He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord , the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany .
Active in the early 1920s , F.C.S . Schiller labelled his work " humanism " but for Schiller the term referred to the pragmatist philosophy he shared with William James . In 1929 , Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley , John Dewey , Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann . Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife , Clara Cook Potter , published Humanism : A New Religion . Throughout the 1930s , Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as , women’s rights , access to birth control , " civil divorce laws " , and an end to capital punishment .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Eliot and her circle , who included her companion George Henry Lewes ( the biographer of Goethe ) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau , were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte , whom Martineau had translated . Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity ( which worshiped the dead , since most humans who have ever lived are dead ) , complete with holidays and liturgy , modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism . Although Comte 's English followers , like Eliot and Martineau , for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system , they liked the idea of a religion of humanity . Comte 's austere vision of the universe , his injunction to " vivre pour altrui " ( " live for others " , from which comes the word " altruism " ) , and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy .
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah 's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory . In 1933 , there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses in Germany , of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned . Of those , 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . In Canada , Jehovah 's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent . In the former Soviet Union , about 9,300 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951 . Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including China , Vietnam and some Islamic states .
Among the Punjabi poets , the names of Sultan Bahu , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Baksh , and Waris Shah and folk singers like Inayat Hussain Bhatti and Tufail Niazi , Alam Lohar , Sain Marna , Mansoor Malangi , Allah Ditta Lona wala , Talib Hussain Dard , Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi , Gamoo Tahliwala , Mamzoo Gha-lla , Akbar Jat , Arif Lohar , Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known . In the composition of classical ragas , there are such masters as Malika-i-Mauseequi ( Queen of Music ) Roshan Ara Begum , Ustad Amanat Ali Khan , Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan . Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature , by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979 .
All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge , and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions . Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends . The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts .
In America , Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement 's seminal influence . In the United Kingdom , Colin Urquhart , Michael Harper , David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments . The Massey conference in New Zealand , 1964 was attended by several Anglicans , including the Rev . Ray Muller , who went on to invite Bennett to New Zealand in 1966 , and played a leading role in developing and promoting the Life in the Spirit seminars . Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky .
Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired . Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans , while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism . In selecting a Chief Justice , Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives , noting privately that Warren " represents the kind of political , economic , and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court ... He has a national name for integrity , uprightness , and courage that , again , I believe we need on the Court " . In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court .
Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide , typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire . Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict . ( See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide )
Eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army 's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy . He was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast . His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System . Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956 .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD , when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet . This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature . Early Armenian literature was written by the " father of Armenian history " , Moses of Chorene , who authored The History of Armenia . The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD . The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature . This period of time , during which Armenian culture flourished , is known as the Revival period ( Zartonki sherchan ) . The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis , almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe , were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism . Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience , and preferred them over classical Armenian ( grabar ) . This period ended after the Hamidian massacres , when Armenians experienced turbulent times . As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed , writers like Paruyr Sevak , Gevork Emin , Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature .
Regardless of the way the tension between universities , individual scientists , and the scientific revolution itself is perceived , there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed . Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction , but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting . The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution , and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation , initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines . Instead of entering higher education to become a " general scholar " immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum , there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself . The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge .
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
^Note 2 : in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows : " Article IV . Section 10 . No person within this state shall , upon any pretense , be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience , nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rate , for the building or repairing any place of worship , or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry , contrary to what he believes to be right , or hath voluntarily engaged to do .

Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .
Much of YouTube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . In 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . In May 2013 , Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . In February 2015 , Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
Protestantism spread in Europe during the 16th century . Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] Denmark , [ d ] Norway , [ e ] Sweden , [ f ] Finland , [ g ] Prussia , [ h ] Latvia , [ i ] , Estonia , [ j ] and Iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] Hungary , [ m ] the Netherlands , [ n ] Scotland , [ o ] Switzerland , [ p ] and France [ q ] by such reformers as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . Arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany . In 1534 , King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England [ s ] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of Edward VI , through Thomas Cranmer , Richard Hooker , Matthew Parker and other theologians . There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist , Moravian , and other Pietistic movements . In later centuries , Protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens , that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama , Vice President Biden , White House staff , and several cabinet secretaries . Similarly , in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd 's video " My story : Struggling , bullying , suicide , self-harm " , legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy .
" We used a technique of laying our program out in general debate , " he said . When we got to the amendment phase , we would offer our program as a substitute for the Johnson proposal . If we lost in the Committee of the Whole , then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that . And if we lost on the motion to recommit , our Republican members had a choice : They could vote against the Johnson program and say we did our best to come up with a better alternative . Or they could vote for it and make the same argument . Usually we lost ; but when you 're only 140 out of 435 , you do n't expect to win many .
Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel , who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ . In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exhaltation of Adam . In the apse the Ascension of Christ . The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
Larry Christenson , a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro , California , did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans . A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in Minneapolis . Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential ; especially " Hosanna ! " in Lakeville , and North Heights in St. Paul . The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the Alliance of Renewal Churches . There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach . Richard A. Jensen 's Touched by the Spirit published in 1974 , played a major role of the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement .
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
In July 1953 , an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 . The armistice and boundary remain in effect today , with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it . The armistice , concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles , South Korean President Syngman Rhee , and also within Eisenhower 's party , has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration . Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable , and limited war unwinnable .
The capital and largest city is Lahore which was the historical capital of the wider Punjab region . Other important cities include Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Gujranwala , Sargodha , Multan , Sialkot , Bahawalpur , Gujrat , Sheikhupura , Jhelum and Sahiwal . Undivided Punjab is home to six rivers , of which five flow through Pakistani Punjab . From west to east , these are : the Indus , Jhelum , Beas , Chenab , Ravi and Sutlej . Nearly 60 % of Pakistan 's population lives in the Punjab . It is the nation 's only province that touches every other province ; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad . In the acronym P-A-K-I-S-T-A-N , the P is for Punjab .

The humanists ' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods . By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin , they applied the principle of ad fontes , or back to the sources , across broad areas of learning , seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors . In 1439 , while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon ( at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States ) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis , now called philology , to prove that the Donation of Constantine , which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome , was an 8th-century forgery . For the next 70 years , however , neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way . Instead , after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453 , which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy , humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism , hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches , and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world . The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts , not only of Plato and Aristotle , but also of the Christian Gospels , previously unavailable in the Latin West .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
World literature was enriched by the works of Edmund Spenser , John Milton , John Bunyan , John Donne , John Dryden , Daniel Defoe , William Wordsworth , Jonathan Swift , Johann Wolfgang Goethe , Friedrich Schiller , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Edgar Allan Poe , Matthew Arnold , Conrad Ferdinand Meyer , Theodor Fontane , Washington Irving , Robert Browning , Emily Dickinson , Emily Brontë , Charles Dickens , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Thomas Stearns Eliot , John Galsworthy , Thomas Mann , William Faulkner , John Updike , and many others .
Provide Campaign Assistance . Minority leaders are typically energetic and aggressive campaigners for partisan incumbents and challengers . There is hardly any major aspect of campaigning that does not engage their attention . For example , they assist in recruiting qualified candidates ; they establish " leadership PACs " to raise and distribute funds to House candidates of their party ; they try to persuade partisan colleagues not to retire or run for other offices so as to hold down the number of open seats the party would need to defend ; they coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national party campaign committees ; they encourage outside groups to back their candidates ; they travel around the country to speak on behalf of party candidates ; and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant financial contributions to the party 's campaign committee . " The amount of time that [ Minority Leader ] Gephardt is putting in to help the DCCC [ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] is unheard of , " noted a Democratic lobbyist . " No DCCC chairman has ever had that kind of support . "
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
Rome 's government , politics and religion were dominated by an educated , male , landowning military aristocracy . Approximately half Rome 's population were slave or free non-citizens . Most others were plebeians , the lowest class of Roman citizens . Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights ; far fewer could actually exercise them . Women had no vote . However , all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices , in the name of the senate and people of Rome . " In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine , just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans " .
Throughout his presidency , Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism . A self-described " progressive conservative , " he continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation , especially Social Security . He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers . He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years , which had not been completed under Truman .
The Plymouth Brethren are a conservative , low church , evangelical movement , whose history can be traced to Dublin , Ireland , in the late 1820s , originating from Anglicanism . Among other beliefs , the group emphasizes sola scriptura . Brethren generally see themselves not as a denomination , but as a network , or even as a collection of overlapping networks , of like-minded independent churches . Although the group refused for many years to take any denominational name to itself—a stance that some of them still maintain—the title The Brethren , is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as brethren .
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .

Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
Small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside of Armenia for centuries . For example , a community has existed for over a millennium in the Holy Land , and one of the four quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem has been called the Armenian Quarter . An Armenian Catholic monastic community of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near Venice , Italy . There are also remnants of formerly populous communities in India , Myanmar , Thailand , Belgium , Portugal , Italy , Poland , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria , Romania , Serbia , Ethiopia , Sudan and Egypt .

Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe , although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals . The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár ( Alba Regia ) had a mosaic decoration in the apse . It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen , executed in the first decades of the 11th century . The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century . The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal . It was executed by Venetian craftsmen .
While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world , Armenians ( especially in the diaspora ) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations . These include the Armenian Catholic Church ( which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the Roman Catholic Pope ) , the Armenian Evangelical Church , which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away , and the Armenian Brotherhood Church , which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church , but later broke apart from it . There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds .
Edgar took the first turn at school , and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery . Edgar asked for a second year , Dwight consented and worked for a second year . At that time , a friend " Swede " Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school , since no tuition was required . Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S . Senator , Joseph L. Bristow . Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition , he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy . He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911 .
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
In November 1942 , he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations ( NATOUSA ) through the new operational Headquarters Allied ( Expeditionary ) Force Headquarters ( A ( E ) FHQ ) . The word " expeditionary " was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons . The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned underground within the Rock of Gibraltar . Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years .
In 2009 , Hispanic and Latino Americans represented 52.0 % of the Bronx 's population . Puerto Ricans represented 23.2 % of the borough 's population . Over 72,500 Mexicans lived in the Bronx , and they formed 5.2 % of the population . Cubans numbered over 9,640 members and formed 0.7 % of the population . In addition , over 319,000 people were of various Hispanic and Latino groups , such as Dominican , Salvadoran , and so on . These groups collectively represented 22.9 % of the population . At the 2010 Census , 53.5 % of Bronx 's population was of Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) . Asian Americans are a small but sizable minority in the borough . Roughly 49,600 Asians make up 3.6 % of the population . Roughly 13,600 Indians call the Bronx home , along with 9,800 Chinese , 6,540 Filipinos , 2,260 Vietnamese , 2,010 Koreans , and 1,100 Japanese .
Official cults were state funded as a " matter of public interest " ( res publica ) . Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities . The difference between public and private cult is often unclear . Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities . The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults , and held the state-funded ( thus public ) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival , which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors . Some rites of the domus ( household ) were held in public places but were legally defined as privata in part or whole . All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and pontifices .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous ; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian . There was also a drop in south polar temperatures ; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period , though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not . These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics , where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers . A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction , one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard . This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period .
The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties , including the power of reason . That means that they are allowed to explore God 's creation and , according to Genesis 2:15 , make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way . Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences . Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers , in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ , are to follow God 's commandments . Industry , frugality , calling , discipline , and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code . In particular , Calvin rejected luxury . Therefore , craftsmen , industrialists , and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology . As a result , productivity grew , which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages . In this way , the economy , the sciences , and technology reinforced each other . The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors . The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution . This idea is also known as the " Protestant ethic thesis . "
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925 , and continued through the Democrats ' control of the House from 1931 to 1995 , save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55 , all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent . The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965 , Hale Boggs who died in a plane crash , and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats ' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections . Since 1995 , the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner , though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections . He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011 . In 1998 , with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation , both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert .
Bronx native Nancy Savoca 's 1989 comedy , True Love , explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding . The film , which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple , won the Grand Jury Prize at that year 's Sundance Film Festival . The CBS television sitcom Becker , 1998–2004 , was more ambiguous . The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker , a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients , co-workers , friends , and practically everything and everybody else in his world . It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx .
That evening , Eisenhower 's body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene , Kansas , the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an American president . His body arrived on April 2 , and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library . The president 's body was buried as a General of the Army . The family used an $ 80 standard soldier 's casket , and dressed Eisenhower 's body in his famous short green jacket . His only medals worn were : the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , and the Legion of Merit . Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud , who died at age 3 in 1921 . His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979 .
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style , free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space . Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences . Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . Concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . While YouTube 's revenue-sharing " Partner Program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels " . In 2013 Forbes ' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media . In 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega " , " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo . By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts .
The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960 . A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858 . Each of the designs incorporates the text " with appreciation " or " with personal and official gratitude " accompanied with Eisenhower 's initials " D.D.E . " or facsimile signature . The design also incorporates location , date , and/or significant event . Prior to the end of his second term as President , 1,451 medals were turned-in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed . The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series .
Within the diasporan Armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of Armenians . For example , Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as Parskahay ( Պարսկահայ ) , while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as Lipananahay ( Լիբանանահայ ) . Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language . This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine , Russia , and Georgia ( where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province ) . In diverse communities ( such as in Canada and the U.S. ) where many different kinds of Armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
As the 1954 congressional elections approached , and it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses , Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses , and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP . Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate , progressive Republican : " I have just one purpose ... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country . If the right wing wants a fight , they are going to get it ... before I end up , either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I wo n't be with them anymore . "
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
Until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the German university model had spread around the world . Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . In Britain , the move from Industrial Revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray ( chairman of the University Grants Committee ) and Sir Samuel Curran , with the formation of the University of Strathclyde . The British also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in Europe .
Until March 1 , 2009 , the Borough President of the Bronx was Adolfo Carrión Jr. , elected as a Democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy . His successor , Democratic New York State Assembly member Rubén Díaz , Jr. , who won a special election on April 21 , 2009 by a vote of 86.3 % ( 29,420 ) on the " Bronx Unity " line to 13.3 % ( 4,646 ) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the " People First " line , became Borough President on May 1 .
During the later part of the Malla era , Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities : Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , and Kirtipur . These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal . These states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . Evidence of an influx of ideas from India , Tibet , China , Persia , and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla . Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g . Tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g . Haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g . Mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . Amarkosh , a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD , was also found . Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square , Patan Durbar Square , Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the former durbar of Kirtipur , Nyatapola , Kumbheshwar , the Krishna temple , and others .
Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years ( Deflem , 2002 ) . For example , in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals . A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London . The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe , which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War . There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( Nadelmann , 1993 ) . It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception . It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( Sheptycki , 2000 ) .
In Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) , the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause . The court 's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable , " the court wrote . " Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a " wall , " is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "
In November 1942 , he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations ( NATOUSA ) through the new operational Headquarters Allied ( Expeditionary ) Force Headquarters ( A ( E ) FHQ ) . The word " expeditionary " was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons . The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned underground within the Rock of Gibraltar . Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years .
Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France . This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed , just a week before departure . Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time , despite being given the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home . [ citation needed ] In World War II , rivals who had combat service in the first great war ( led by Gen. Bernard Montgomery ) sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty , despite his stateside experience establishing a camp , completely equipped , for thousands of troops , and developing a full combat training schedule .
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
Besides being the political center , Brasília is an important economic center . Brasília has the highest city gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 99.5 billion reais representing 3.76 % of the total Brazilian GDP . The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function . Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District . Being a city registered by UNESCO , the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software , film , video , and gemology among others , with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance , preserving the city property .
Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor . The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933 , 1937 and 1941 ( and in the latter two elections , only because his 30-32 % vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22-23 % as a Republican ) . The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 . The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31 % of the Bronx 's vote , putting him second and well ahead of the 20 % won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel , who came in second ( ahead of Hillquit ) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2 % to 21.7 % .
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( Ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian . Geologically , the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . Throughout the early Paleozoic , the Earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea , which included most of the Earth 's land area .
Punjab ( Urdu , Punjabi : پنجاب , panj-āb , " five waters " : listen ( help·info ) ) , also spelled Panjab , is the most populous of the four provinces of Pakistan . It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres ( 79,284 square miles ) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011 , approximately 56 % of the country 's total population . Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore . Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east . In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south , Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north .
In 1963 , the Robbins Report on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "
Just as artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci – partaking of the zeitgeist though not himself a humanist – advocated study of human anatomy , nature , and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art , so Spanish-born humanist Juan Luis Vives ( c. 1493–1540 ) advocated observation , craft , and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities , helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism . Thus , the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to natural philosophy , based on empirical observations and experimentation of the physical universe , making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
Valerian 's first religious edict singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult , outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome 's traditional gods . His second edict acknowledged a Christian threat to the Imperial system – not yet at its heart but close to it , among Rome’s equites and Senators . Christian apologists interpreted his disgraceful capture and death as divine judgement . The next forty years were peaceful ; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile , due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence . Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius ' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a “pagan” basis in Christian heresies . The Christian churches were disunited ; Paul of Samosata , Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 for " dogmatic reasons – his doctrine on the human nature of Christ was rejected – and for his lifestyle , which reminded his brethren of the habits of the administrative elite " . The reasons for his deposition were widely circulated among the churches . Meanwhile , Aurelian ( 270-75 ) appealed for harmony among his soldiers ( concordia militum ) , stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official , Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome 's Campus Martius .
